<p>Lately I’ve been appreciating slowness: my capacity to have lots of creative projects developing slowly and simultaneously; slow communication like emails and letters; seeking out regular ways to keep in touch with people; slowly. I’m dealing with (and preparing for more) Big Scary Changes in my life and enjoying my own company whilst trying not to turn into a lonely hermit again like I did in Winter.</p>
<p>After an injury that made my dominant hand unusable for a while, I’m feeling really appreciative of everything I can do with my hands. I’m playing guitar every other day, reconnecting with my super cool old drum tutor to fix up my technique, and I’ve started learning violin.</p>
<!-- <p>My family have been jamming as a band often, preparing for a little studio gig in a couple weeks. If you’re local to Mulubinba and would like to come along to a not-so-secret party, <a href="contact.html">please reach out</a> and I’ll send you the details!</p> -->
<p>I’m really enjoying taking scraps of my past (from journals, sketchbooks, recordings, photographs, screenshots…) and <em>re-de-contexualising</em> them as <a href="memos.html">memos</a>. Making webpages as letters to friends. I've started a journal-like page, <a href="log.html">a scrapbook of mnemonics</a>. I’ve thought about doing this for while &mdash; maybe I could make some of them into zines, under a pseudonym (it’s nice to have secrets for yourself).</p>
<p><em>Actual Air</em>, a collection of poems from David Berman, has sat on my bedside table for a year and it’s had a lovely effect on my journalling, turning everyday moments into candid poetry.</p>
<p>I’ve been listening to music that I’d (lovingly) call scrappy like caroline, Fievel is Glauque, deianara, Micah Preite, The Dirty Three, Jim Guthrie's demos, and enjoying all the beautiful textures of these <strike>amateurish</strike> <em>honest</em> recordings. I’m gradually excavating a lot of my forgotten musical ideas and other juvenilia from hard drives, thinking I’ve got a record (or three) worth of stuff here that I could scrap together.</p>
<p>I’ve been helping facilitate art workshops with kids and they’ve been the highlight of my weeks. I’m working towards running some myself in Summer, aiming at teaching teenagers how to creatively code with Processing. I’ve done lots of creative coding but not much with Processing and I’m really excited to be going so quickly from learning to teaching!</p>
<p>I’m excited to get involved with this local activist group who are interested in self-sovereign networks — finally a good reason to explore all this off-grid-web stuff I’ve been reading about for a while. They’re currently collecting old cellphones and distributing them to people in need, which is a great project I’d love to be a part of. This opportunity has my brain racing with all the things we could setup (solar-powered server? jailbreaking workshops? an anarchist wiki on an intranet?). I’m hoping to meet more people interested in the technical side of activism so I don’t just become their resident computer-toucher (although I’m not totally opposed to that idea and the opportunity to teach people as I learn).</p>
<p>I’m <em>ritualising</em> my everyday life: grounding, setting intentions and working towards them inside of containers of time. Lighting a candle, setting intentions, speaking them into my magic kazoo, putting on an album. Avoiding overwhelm by keeping my internet connection off by default and getting more comfortable using the terminal (<code>my grimoire grows and grows</code>).</p>
<p>When I am online I’m usually exploring the small web, trying to find my own ways to be social within that. I recently discovered the nekoweb which is joyous. Social media mostly stinks. I created a new Twitter and Bluesky account to connect with some new gamedev friends but being exposed to those algorithmic feeds makes me ill. My time in the fediverse has been okay, I’ve made some lovely mutuals who I’d like to stay connected with, but I still don’t think I’ve ever taken enough time to reconsider how I’d like to use social media in a way that doesn’t make me mostly miserable. Aside from interacting with other folks’ cool posts, I don’t really know what I want to share? Some of my mutuals in smaller servers seem to be having a pretty nice time, maybe I could ask them if I could join theirs.</p>
<p>When I got this site online I had a huge to-do list of things I wanted to add to it, which totally sucked the joy out of it and made me not want to touch it for a while. I had a little period of getting obsessed with automating <em>how</em> I make the site which made me forget about <em>what</em> I even wanted to add to the site in the first place. I’ve come out of that hyperfixation hole with a newfound joy for just writing HTML and CSS (and a nice little spell for making a page when I want to skip some of the menial stuff). I’m exploring <em>what a website could be</em>—taking some of the things you’d expect from a personal site (a blog, a changelog, a sitemap…) and doing them in my own weird way.</p>
<p>I’m getting really obsessed with web stuff, with maybe three or four or even five potential website projects coming up (woa slow down buddy). I’d planned to be doing a web developer certificate around now (getting paid for making cool websites could be cool) but this a way cooler way to learn I think.</p>
<p>A little while ago I learnt how to use a screen reader so I could understand what the experience of exploring my site with that was like, and felt like I’d unlocked a magical new way to use my ’puter. I tried to bootstrap accessibility onto my interactive web-poem which was a challenge (I realised that was a bit of an oxymoron: you kinda need to consider that from the beginning) and now I’m having a lot of fun exploring poetic uses of web and assistive technologies. I’m sure there’s prior art here but I’m enjoying the process of experimentation and discovery at my own pace.</p>
<p>I’ve been itching to get back into low-poly modelling and gamedev stuff. I made a game in a short game jam a couple months ago that I’m really proud of. Maybe I’ll do more of those weekend-long jams, or join some longer, slower paced ones to gradually manifest some bigger projects, like the “song as a game” I keep telling people about.</p>
