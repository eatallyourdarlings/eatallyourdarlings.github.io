# Rain
> step lightly, do not go gently.

Rain spends most of their time looking, [listening](radio.md), climbing, dancing with their staff, sandsurfing, collecting [curios](curios.md) and playing with [thingamabobs](thingamabob.md).  A psychogeographer, maybe.

They're non-verbal but not in the '*soulless video game protagonist that you can give your own voice*' kind of way. They've got their own curious and awkward voice in how they use and learn new [non-verbal languages](language.md). They whistle birdsongs. They are skilled at slyly, playfully and silently diffusing heightening situations.

Rain was in [Eris](Eris.md)' nasty dogpack during their teenage years, and before that their memory is hazy. They managed to escape, but they've been lonely for a long time since then, and are really just seeking community. They're a naÃ¯ve wanderer that can hopefully bring about a [Spring](Spring.md).

[Scrimshaw](Scrimshaw.md) helps them re-love their body with tattoos, and [Cephi](Cephi.md) teaches them how to unmask.

> I spell non-speaking and not non-verbal, because non-verbal means without words, and I am not without words.

At moments of rest, Rain will sit at a makeshift camp, doze off, and [dream](dream.md). They find it difficult to dream without their [radio](radio.md), and they're increasingly restless the closer they get to [Utopia](Utopia-Planitia.md). 

The vicarious visions that Rain experiences clouds their dreams, stopping them from being able to revisit their own early memories, as well as because of intense of intense childhood trauma that makes it hard for them to remember things, or form new memories. [Val](Val.md) *intentionally dreams* to Rain, selectively showing them memories he's collected to groom them into being a [hero](heroes.md) . He constructs a narrative that might make them want to pursue [Eris](Eris.md), leaving himself out of the picture.  Rain is inherently peaceful and acutely empathetic, but they're vulnerable to spongeing up others' jaundiced views of the world, such as coming to believe that violence is necessary - poeple get into Rain's head with sentiments like *you're good at this but you don't use it for anything* and force them weaponise/commodify the things they enjoy. Their staff-dancing and sandsurfing skills shaped into outward violence rather than self-defence or expression.

it's Rain's wandering for the sake of it that unintentionally inspires so many people to [reconnect](oncewaves.md) with each other. whereas Val wanders with ill intentions, and can infect them with that - that they've got a hero's journey to complete.

If go down the violent path, they find an aegis to surf on and learn to do tricks to defend against [eidola](eidolon.md) - *do a [petrifying](hardening.md) kickflip!* 

Violence begets violence, but somebody's got to decide to be radically peaceful to break that cycle.
