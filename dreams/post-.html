<p>we’ve gotta stop calling everything <em>post-</em>something, it’s existential, like everything’s over.</p>

<p>It’s <em>post-post-post-collapse-collapse-collapse</em>. I always wanted to have very little emphasis at all (writing-wise) on the <em>post-apocalypse</em> aspect of the setting. It’s inspired by so many fantasy worlds that are so far post-something in a way that it’s not really known by the characters, and not an important part of the present storyworld, like in <em>Dark Souls</em>, where its past cataclysms provide context to the present/incoming calamity. Like in <em>Rain World</em>, collapse has been a cyclical constant in this world and its eco- (or <a href="Monolith.html">eco-adjacent</a>) systems adapt.</p>
