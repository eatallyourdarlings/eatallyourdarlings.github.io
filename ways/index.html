    <h2>what is a ways folder?</h2>
    <p>
        A ways folder is a place to share how you do or have done things, like halfway between a how-to and a blog post. It's an emerging web convention, like <a href="../now.html">now</a> pages and <a href="../grove/">wikis</a>.
    </p>
    <q>
        Ways is meant to embrace pluralism: not "this is how to do x,” but “this is the way that works for me.”<br>[...]<br>
        I associate it with the concept of folkways, the sociological term for the learned behavior that constitutes the mores and traditions of a community. I’d be perfectly happy to see people use their Ways folders to share actual folkways they’ve inherited, alongside the individual ways they’ve developed. The general vision is of a mode of self-expression grounded in the practicalities of a person’s lived experience. A Ways folder should be more than just an archive of instructions you’ve copied or paraphrased from somewhere else. Everything in it should be personal, experiential, practical. Each page should explain something you’ve made your own.
