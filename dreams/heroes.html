<h1 id="living-other-peoples-stories">living other peoples’ stories</h1>
<p>through their relationship, <a href="Cephi.html">Cephi</a> and <a href="Rain.html">Rain</a> both come to realise how they were groomed into being heroes in other peoples’ stories.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes at night between the creased sheets of my mind <br />
The dead come back to life <br />
And provide advice <br />
Consoling ghosts <br />
Your dreams are the needed host <br />
To talk to those who were once close</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They’re both a <em>tabula rasa</em> in a sense - Rain because of the way their trauma suppresses their memories, and Cephi by her moth-rebirth cycle. So they’re very susceptible to the <a href="dream.html">dreams</a> of others, in a time where it is believed that nobody can dream on their own anymore.</p>
