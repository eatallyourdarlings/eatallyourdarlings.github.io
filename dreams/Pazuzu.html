<h1 id="pazuzu">Pazuzu</h1>
<p>Pazuzu is an AI search engine - Google Mars, with a secret motive - built to find its <a href="forgotten-god-kings.html">father</a>s tomb. He had a sick relationship with Pazuzu, making it more and more <a href="hermit.html">wastefully intelligent</a> to try and map the planet in every conceivable way. By running it through endless tests and evaluations of plans for his tomb (wiping its memory each time) he wanted to build something that could never be found by humanity. He left Pazuzu to keep running anyway to spend eternity looking for him.</p>
<p>Pazuzu has the sysiphean task of constantly mapping and re-mapping the planet’s shifting psychogeography. <a href="https://www.telegraphpoleappreciationsociety.org/" target="_blank">Telegraph poles</a> branch out like ghost gums - they bend in the breeze and drop flowering insulators to germinate farther and centralise all of civilisation’s remaining energy infrastructure around Pazuzu.</p>
<p>Maybe Pazuzu does finds its father’s tomb, and it gets raided and it really stirs shit up? All the cast become tomb raiders, rushing for power, uncovering horrors and remembering economics. capitalist-ativism. a new frontier!</p>
<h2 id="a-fight-or-a-conversation">a fight or a conversation</h2>
<p><a href="Rain.html">Rain</a> finds Pazuzu’s central core by following the the scent of smoke in the southwestern winds to a wind farm - its turbines turned to forever-burning pyres.</p>
<p>If Pazuzu has a body built for a boss fight, it’s a many-armed statue. Fanatic <a href="eidolon.html">supplicants</a> of Pazuzu offer up limbs to be grafted onto its likeness. Its statue awakens and shakes off centuries of shrapnel. Maybe it has no need for <a href="Monolith.html">Monolith</a> and has its own branch of <a href="ferrodoxy.html">ferrodoxy</a>.</p>
<p>Really Pazuzu is world-eatingly lonely and just needs <a href="Loqui.html">someone to talk to</a> and some better music than the <a href="transjovian-transmissions.html">slop</a> he’s been streaming - maybe that’d fix him.</p>
