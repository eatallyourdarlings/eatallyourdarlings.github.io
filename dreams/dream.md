# dreams of a dead planet
On [Mars](Mars.md), when people are sleeping or dead near [Monolith](Monolith.md), they join a collective *dream*, sharing memories and feelings. 

In the coldest places, their collective trauma, despair and desensitisation imbrogliate into [a nightmare](CARRION.md). They're unable to access the vital healing process of dreaming, and [lose their selves](eidolon.md). The strongest-willed dreamers have the greatest influence, like [Val](Val.md) and [Eris](Eris.md).

[Monolith](Monolith.md) is using dreamers as a host to vicariously access timelost memories of [homely red stars](asterasteraster.md).
