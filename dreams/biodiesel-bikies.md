# PHO && DEIM

a note in my phone, circa 2021? that brought me so much joy: bikie gangs vs centaurs

PHO && DEIM are two biodiesel bikie gangs, with rival allegiances to the moons. they're post-military warmongerers with obsessed with the Roman Empire (hahaha) 

**[post-solarpunk](post-solarpunk.md) revheads.** totally ripping off *The Cars That Ate Paris*, imagining an alternate history for that aesthetic that's like solarpunk but totally missing the point.

**full of spite.** they fuck with each other's [signals](radio.md) for no good reason, they've actually got pretty complementary tastes in music, but they wouldn't know.

PHO gang are scrap-heapers from the nuclear waste labyrinth and DEIM are city-side sky-bikies. kiteriders, perhaps. 

they're bad anarchists, fetishising chaos whilst actually raging against it. in an arms race to find a technical solution to the problem of the moons and the climate (that will be resolved by letting gravity do its thing) they're making the situation a lot worse. maybe DEIM can find allegiance with [Eris](Eris.md), scouting out the gravitational weapons of the city and its underground, to find something to kill [Phobos](Phobos.md).

DEIM are marginally more prejudiced than PHO, the latter being a mix of bots and flesh-havers. maybe both gangs unite in their prejudice against the centaurs of [Concrete_Forest](Concrete_Forest.md), if [Nuckelavee](Nuckelavee.md) becomes a real problem, but they take it too far, of course. If they can be helped to reflect on the unity of that culture's joint faith in [Sadar-Deneb](Sadar-Deneb.md), they can reflect on the futility of their dualities and maybe conjoin their gangs to help build more stable networks.
