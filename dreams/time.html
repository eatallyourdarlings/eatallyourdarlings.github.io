<h1 id="time-doesnt-care-about-you">time doesn’t care about you</h1>
<p>Every body’s perception of time is fucked in part because of trauma; exacerbated by the way that <a href="Monolith.html">Monolith</a> can inhabit these feelings; the fact that they all <a href="dream.html">dream together</a>, that chemical/geological time has become ungrounded, at the whims of their wishes.</p>
<p>Things are really <em>off</em> for humans who’ve only every known <a href="Mars.html">Mars</a>. Days are ~25.5 <a href="Earth.html">Earth</a> hours. They feel especially disconnected because of the infrequency of the moons orbits, which have drastically changed over generations. <a href="Luna.html">Old ways</a> of telling time don’t make sense any more.</p>
<p>Days being called <a href="Sol.html"><em>sols</em></a> feels kinda areocentric. A return to <a href="ferrodoxy.html">antiquated beliefs</a> that they’re the centre of the universe?</p>
<p>Years could be told by the rough time until it is believed that <a href="Phobos.html">Phobos</a> will impact the planet and <a href="Deimos.html">Deimos</a> will slip its orbit, in the format <code>-49, 990, 090</code>. The exact year that the story takes place has been lost to time, but this doomsday clock has taken on more of a spiritual significance, contributing to the feeling of existential dread.</p>
<p><a href="Enyo.html">Enyo</a> watches a literal doomsday clock still ticking down past zero and into the negative.</p>
<p>what’s that phenomena where the climate creates a crazy bright day? did I imagine that?</p>
