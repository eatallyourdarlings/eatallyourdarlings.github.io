# what's that frequency?
> it's the frequency [they](eidolon.md) dream at, and it's never the same twice.

[Rain](Rain.md) wanders and picks up [oneiric](dream.md) radio frequencies on [the thingamabob](thingamabob.md). Through triangulation they piece together halves/fractions/fractals of strange signals. They start off just listening to [Loqui](Loqui.md)'s favourite tunes but follow music to meet [other folk](cast.md). Everyone's got a pirate radio station, how else are you meant to listen to music?

- [transjovian-transmissions](transjovian-transmissions.md)
- [Eris && Enyo](Eris-Enyo.md#yearning%20in%20mono) have a toxic shared playlist, of course.
