[Rain](Rain.md) navigates [Mars](Mars.md)' uncanny psychogeography with the help of a thingamabob inhabited by [imaginary friends](Loqui.md) and they bootstrap functionality onto it with the help of [Scrimshaw](Scrimshaw.md) and others. It allows them to become a sort of radio-archaeologist, picking up on frequencies from long-defunct satellite arrays, pirate [radio](radio.md) communications, music between distant lovers and anomalous signals from deep space. Frequency fossicking for the imprint of curios on a 2-dimension oscilloscope.

> They seek voices in the cosmic microwave background, marching to polyrhythms in the music of the spheres.

It has quirky, ‘virtually tactile’ interactions, e.g:

Crossing the Gobi Desert, Marco Polo wrote of a low hum. The dunes were singing. In the oldest deserts in the world, large dunes that are made up of lots of sand grains of the same size create resonance when they slide over each other.

DXing is searching for [radio](radio.md) broadcasts far away. They don't transmit anything themselves, just listen in. Most DXing happens at night because sunlight effects radio propagation. **At sunset, DXers search for signals from the east - at sunrise, the west.** At midnight, signals from all directions can be heard but interference is high.
