<p>Hey Mali :]</p>
<p>Right now I’m sitting in the yard on a lovely Spring afternoon, and I hope you’re having a nice day too. It’s been a while! I’ve been thinking of you, and I’ve wanted to tell you this story for a while. It happened almost a year ago, after the last time we had a beautiful jam, and I’d like to call it “Mali and Magic Guitar Picks” - sounds like a nice song or folk tale.</p>
<p>The morning before our jam I’d been in a music store dealing with obnoxious guitar dudes, which I’m sure you’re familiar with. At checkout I decided to pocket some beautiful guitar picks (partly out of spite). There was one particular lovely tortoise-shell gold one that stuck out to me, and I brought it with me to the jam with you. When I shared with you that song that I’d been writing, I used that lovely little gold pick to play your guitar. Using that pick and playing that song with you felt a bit magic. I’d been feeling a bit of stuck with it, but jamming on it with you it felt different, it felt loud, and it helped me gt unstuck for a time.</p>
<p>I didn’t mean to, but I left the gold guitar pick tucked under the strings of your guitar when I left, or maybe I dropped it in your big reverby room. I realised I’d lost it while I was on the three-hour train trip back home. I was like “oh no my magical guitar pick” for a minute, but then I thought that maybe you would find it and use it and fill it up with even more magic and one day I’d see you using it.</p>
<p>The beautiful part is that when I got off at the platform I looked down and between my feet was an almost identical guitar pick, in a gorgeous green to match the gold. It was a bit of spooky action at a distance!</p>
<p>I thought I’d tell you this story next time I saw you, and hopefully I’ll see you soon, we’re just such busy people. I can’t believe it’s been almost a year - that time has flown by! That little bit of magic from you sustained me for a while, but I’ve still had a difficult relationship with that one song. Just recently I found that magic green pick again in my pocket, and used it to revisit that song. I’m trying to seeing it through this time, as an act of self-love, because sometimes you need to put things to rest. Anyways, hope you have a beautiful birthday and I’ll see you soon! Can’t wait ’til we next get to jam.</p>
<p>Big love,<br />
Olive ⁂</p>
