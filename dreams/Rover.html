<h1 id="rover">Rover</h1>
<p>A <a href="curios.html">curio</a>-collector robot, inhabited by the spirit of a timelost <a href="asterasteraster.html">stardog</a>. It likes to collect and vacuum-seal fossils and opals. It follows the same old trails, on a round-trip of a couple decades. Bit of a chicken-egg paradox; there’s always been a dog in the machine, but it’s also following ancient guidance paths from <a href="Earth.html">Earth</a>, but those paths are intuitive to a dog…</p>

<th>Mars from low orbit, and Phobos is approaching the camera fast. Maybe a lil <a href="satellite.html">satellite</a> is visible to get an idea of the time period. A fireball streaks across the sky towards the planet, and Phobos closes in on the camera. As it turns towards to the light of the sun, a strange tree-like object is visible on its surface.</th>

<p>Rain: A figure wrapped in shawls and a wooly jacket is crouched next to the wreckage. No part of their body is visible but for their eyes and the bridge of their nose. Headphones around their neck are spitting static.</p>
<p>Zoom in closer as their face is illuminated from underneath by the orange glow of a small device. They stand up, disconnecting wires linking the wreckage to their device.</p>

<td>Slow zoom on their face as a gust of wind blows away their scarf - a faint orange blinking lights their cheeks and Deimos’ moonlight reflects in their eyes while it’s brother’s remains creep from the horizon behind Rain’s head. They put their headphones on, then play with a knob on the device and music fades in like they’ve found a radio signal.</td>

<tr>
<td>Rain comes across a small rowboat on the crest of a dune, pushes it and jumps in it and glides down. The boat stops next to some derelict coastal military flotsam, and they stand up and pass these by as if they’re not unusual. Further on, shipwrecks can be seen on the horizon, weathered and salt-encrusted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rain’s boot catches on something in the salt and they pause for a moment to crouch down. A faint clicking sound starts coming from their device. They pick up and inspect some stone curio. As they pick up the fossil the clicking increases slightly in tempo and volume.</td>

<td>Rain stands back up, plays with some knob on their device and continues walking faster.</td>

<p>The Rover pauses to take a photo of Phobos eclipsing the sun. Through the viewfinder and the reflections in the rover’s eye-lens we see the thin ring of light around Phobos start to be iridescent like an opal. The music starts to build to a climax.</p>
<table style="width:6%;">

<tr>
<th>Montage of Rain unearthing more curios in the salt, the clicking sound increasing further, the soundtrack becoming more dissonant and chaotic. A series of shots focuses on Rain’s hands as they pick each artefact up, sand running out of its crevices and through their fingers. The last fossils are recognisable as human parts, but with the texture of petrified wood.</th>

<tr>
<td>Music breaks up into static, but not entirely. Overhead shot of the boat at the beginning of the salt lake; a hyena skulks in from the bottom of frame, nose to the ground, pan to follow Rain’s red footprints where they’ve broken through the white salt.</td>

</table>
<p>Close-up side-on of the hyena’s nose stopping at one of the footprints. Its head shoots up and it looks straight ahead (right), before turning around with its head bowed and skulking back. Pan left until the hyena comes into the shadow of a figure - Eris, squatted down, above the shoulders out of the shot. One huge hand fingering the red sand/clay to try and gauge how fresh the prints are. She pauses for a second to feel the clay between thumb and index finger; the mutt whimpers and the hand reaches out to pet it roughly, streaking red clay across its ear.</p>

<tr>
<th>Wider, less orthogonal shot (like 3/4 or 7/8ths perspective) as Eris stands up and the hyena bows its head submissively again. She wears much less warm covering than Rain, and a stone root network is spreading from her spine, across her shoulders, down her arms. A shawl covers her face and neck. Her hands are fists at her sides, her legs square with her shoulders, standing slightly hunched - like all her rage is held in her shoulders. She stares ahead for a beat, her hair and clothes are picked up by the wind.</th>

<td>She reaches for her radio attached to a thigh holster, flicks a switch and the static cuts out.</td>

<th>The hyena starts to howl (hoot?) at the ground and chatter comes from behind Eris, as the rest of the pack runs down the dune, cackling and kicking up dust. Pan in on Eris to see clearer the mix of apathy and rage in her heavy eyes, and a peak at the stone texture of her skin beneath her shawl.</th>

<p>Cut to Rain standing in front of a stone tree similar to the one on Phobos at beginning, with strange geometry imprinted in the ground around it. The shot is framed same as the previous, with the tree in the same place as the impact.</p>
<p>The flashing of the device’s orange light has increased in frequency to the point where it’s constantly glowing bright orange, and the clicks are so fast at this point and sound eerily similar to a Geiger counter, mixed with the headphones around Rain’s neck spitting out static again.</p>

<td>As Rain searches, the word ‘carrion’ is being chanted very faintly, whispered by many voices in the static. As the chanting and the disturbing static grows, the camera pans from the device upwards to the branches of the monolith. Recognisable parts of the Rover stick out of the trunk, its camera arm sticks out amongst the branches.</td>

<p>Cut back to the device in Rain’s hand, - as they turn the knob increasingly frantically, the noisy display occasionally stabilises into waveforms that look like teeth.</p>

<th>Resume the pan down the length of the monolith, showing that the base of it looks like stone bodies tangled together.</th>

<td>The chanting, clicking and intense static noise climax as it focuses on the roots; stone limbs coiled around each other, knots that resemble faces, bodies growing out of the sand.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Rain sighs as music finally cuts through the static again. They put their headphones on and it shifts from sounding diegetic to just being the soundtrack. The tension resolves for a moment as the music comes back. This moment reinforces how familiar Rain is with this strange world that the bodies don’t even phase them or they don’t notice.</p>

<p>The last signal picked up by the Rover’s arm before its antenna ossified beyond radio range. It was positioned just right to piece together these two halves of a T4T cowboy balled: &gt; if we see this through &gt; I’ll go west with you &gt; we’ll cross the Argyle Sea &gt; and climb the Tharsis Montes &gt; we may hope that by tomorrow &gt; the fighting might have stopped &gt; in the meantime we’re just happy &gt; sleeping in the dust</p>
