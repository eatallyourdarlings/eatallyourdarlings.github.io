The birds help gather [kinder memories](murmuries.md) when traumatised folk are having trouble accessing them on their own.

In Spring, Val's lighthouse is no longer trained on Enyo, it's on automatic, petrifying all the old clockwork birds that were bringing him memories and dreams reinforcing the same old hopeless dogma.

Eris' pack all wear barbed wire bracelets around their wrists. Her willpower over them is so strong that it doesn't need to be directly wired up to telephony.
The language she raised them with doesn't have any room for nuance to talk about their feelings - it's all orders. It has two tenses: speaking as a master or as a dog.
