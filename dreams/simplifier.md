a story dreamt to me by folk of a desert that once scraped sky.



at first, the story was a simple warning:

each generation yields a simplifier. do not fear the simplifier. the simplifier is too good at telling stories badly. the simplifier is a reaper of nuance. find it something else to do or it might use that talent for its own complex ends. do not fear the simplifier.

  

the simplifier adapted. each generation it would manifest in new, more nuanced ways.

  

when it arrived as the archivist and said: do not fear the simplifier, its simplification was understood as good. when it arrived as the architects and said: do not fear the simplifier, its simplification was understood as necessary.

  

in time, details were lost, stories forgotten, while the architects' unimaginative geometries were simplified further by winds and waves.

  

from the dust, folk begun to gather that the old ways were complex. that simplification is forgetting. so when the simplifier manifested again in smaller ways, folk othered it. it was given new nouns to be hissed at, which eventually converged on a singular scorn: archist. a low name for the coldest; the simplest.

  

folk fear that by inhabiting this othering, the simplifier stopped needing to adapt. that it is nothing new, just an other wearing new faces; that it has learnt to persist across generations by exploiting those who yearn to join simpler shapes.

  

fear the simplifier, folk say, as they recollect in warm oases of beautiful complexity, outside of the tyranny of five-fingered hands.
