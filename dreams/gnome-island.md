# gnomes use cigarettes as currency
they all pledges ciggies to the tsar, who has a throne of pipes and other smoking instruments, like you see dictator-kings with their thrones of arms.

*edgy gnome lights fags on its own face*.

imagining it like a Felvidek-style ugly RPGMaker game. really brown.

all the gnomes are boys.

when the gnomes were freed from their plastic prisons ( or when plastic revealed its sentience worldwide ? ) they unionised and took over the private island they all lived on, home to some rich cunt. maybe the tsar is this dead cunt, and they want to keep him appeased so that he can continue to be happy and restful in the afterlife. dark undertones, like they were all abused by him, maybe. 

they fear and resent the fish, planning to wage war against them, even. as they keep washing up on shore and their bellies are full of plastic, maybe it's this fear that's keeping most of them trapped on the island.

power derived from the size of their gnoses. they find a swordfish washed up, the length of four gnomes. they slice open its belly and all cry in horror at the plastic organs within. but there's hope there - this fish has the the biggest gnose they've ever seen, what if it's their king or great hero? and if so, they can finally make a move to escape.

maybe they believe in a flesh/plastic dichotomy, as they've been othered by flesh. plastic flesh = plastish?

oh also it'd be funny asf if they spoke in [Anglish](../bookmarks/Anglish.md)
