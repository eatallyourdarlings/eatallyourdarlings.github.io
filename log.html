<p>I showed up at my friends' woodwork studio to see if I could lend a hand, and spent a lot of time taking photos of the various curios and textures around the place. I think I kinda loaded them with the expectation that I'd collage them into something Really Cool, and I don't love the result. Maybe the process I went through was just not very inspiring&mdash;lots of automation with command-line software&mdash;or it didn't leave enough room for intention. Felt like I was just pushing pixels around for 45 mins until I was sick of it. Here it is, anyway, in the interest of sharing scrappy fiddles or something. I can always come back to it, of course.</p>

<p>two years ago today I sent this scrappy recording of one half of <em>Gatekeeper</em> by Feist to a new friend I'd made, who has a beautiful singing voice. I thought it was a nice gift, hoping they'd sing the other half back, but they didn't. I'm a more confident singer now and it was fun to duet with myself, anyway. it'd really warm my heart to hear your scrappy take on this song (yes, you, hello friend, I'm sure you've got a lovely singing voice, but no pressure xo ).</p>

<p>worked a little more on <a href="tools/dither.html">a little dither tool</a>. I'm enjoying doing a little bit of coding in my pyjamas each morning. It was starting to get not fun, so I put on a nice colourful outfit, went to the garden and picked some strawberries with a neighbour and her granddaughter. I came back fresh-brained and cracked the resizing algorithm. In a bookshop on a rainy afternoon, a friend wandered in just as I was polishing it off. She took a reverse-selfie to try it out, quickly uncovering bugs, which I quickly fixed.</p>

<p>Words bounced around my head all day. I thought about putting them down here, but gave them a little time instead. Before bed I picked up my guitar and played some old chords and the words came out as a song; <a href="softening.html">a softening.</a></p>

You look seventeen, he said,
in my almost-too-small dungarees,
that I had not worn in that long.
I hope not, I thought,
for I was a very sad seventeen year old.
I hope I'm more child now
than I was then.

<p>I've thought about updating my now page for a few days now and it's become a bit of a project in my head, which has made me put it off. I'm concerned about it going out of date, about feeling an obligation to update it. Maybe I feel like being reflective around this time of the month, maybe I don't, that's okay. It's a setting of intentions, which I hope will stay relevant for a time.</p>
