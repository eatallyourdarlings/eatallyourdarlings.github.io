<p>Mars is fucked up bruh! In humanity’s colonial machinations to create a <a href="Earth.html">second Earth</a> it’s a like a dark mirror of so-called-Australia but <strong>fucking cold and irradiated.</strong> Mars is dying a second, slow, violent death after rapid terraforming by <a href="Monolith.html#wishcycle">lossy wishes</a>. Climate change is, of course, terrible for everyone on the planet, but maybe it just wants to go back to sleep? In some regions the atmosphere has thinned so much that radiation, cold or lack of oxygen will kill you. There is <a href="storm.html">an unbreaking thunderhead</a> over the city, the oceans are increasingly violent as <a href="Phobos.html">Phobos</a> gets closer, and deadly dust storms are a regular occurrence.</p>
<p>I read there’s two predominant theories for how Mars’ moons formed - that they were asteroids from the Jupiter-Mars gravity well, or that Mars has a ring cycle similar to Saturn where small satellites break up and reform. I think it’d be pretty beautiful if both were true in a symmetrical way - <a href="Phobos.html">Phobos</a> began as a lost spud and ends up as a broken ring, while <a href="Deimos.html">Deimos</a> formed from a ring and escapes its gravity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The planet is shaped by the sheer amazing force of human want, which has changed everything, the forests, the poles, the reser-voirs, the glaciers, the rivers, the seas, the mountains, the coastlines, the skies, a planet contoured and landscaped by want.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ethics of terraforming, animism, gaiaforms (aeroform?), aerocentrism. climate change reframed by <a href="forgotten-god-kings.html">’naires</a> as necessary to human progress. I think Mars desires to stay dead?</p>
<p>Mars was almost <a href="saturnalia.html">eaten by Saturn and Jupiter</a> in the early formation of the system, and they’re coming back round for a second course.</p>

<p>The people on Mars are displaced, with enough generations distance between them and Earth to question its existence, to ask ‘<em>were we made for this world?</em>’. For it to be a story of hope, <em>despite</em> its bleak setting, the characters need to challenge the question of rather than try to answer it. They rewrite the story on their own terms, finding comfort in the reality that they’re <em>just making do.</em> The intergenerational trauma of a people displaced is complex and manifests questions that they can’t answer. - <em>were we made for a world that we left behind?</em> - <em>did our blue planet even exist?</em> - <em>did we ever leave, or did we just turn our blue planet red?</em> - <em>were we made for any world?</em></p>
<p>The attitude of <a href="Eris.html">Eris</a> and her following is that these stories they grew up on tell of <em>a world that needs to be made for us</em>, as it never existed in the first place.</p>
<p>Many people have been chosen to be reborn as <a href="eidolon.html">eidolons</a> of cloth, stone, iron and bone, following the temptation of the <a href="CARRION.html">CARRION</a>: <em>you could be (re)made for this world.</em> It preys on their need for belonging, and gives them a new story.</p>
<p><a href="Rain.html">Rain</a>’s choice in bringing people together is to challenge the question itself - to create a future where they try to live together in response to the planet’s changing climate than to force it to be <em>made for humans</em>.</p>
