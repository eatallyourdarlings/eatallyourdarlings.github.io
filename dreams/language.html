<h1 id="languages-for-the-ends-of-worlds">languages for the ends of worlds</h1>
<p>people are naturally multilingual, mostly conlangs but very much grounded in real histories of language mixing by necessity - pidgins, trade languages, remnants of battle languages and protocols.</p>
<p>most of the language is <strong>non-verbal</strong> !!!! telephony. <a href="radio.html">radio dreams</a>. Constructed sign languages, for and human-scale-computing-languages. Using <a href="thingamabob.html">the thingamabob</a>, <a href="Rain.html">Rain</a> could even be a translator, an interlocutor.</p>
<p>I’m imagining languages that have evolved or been reinvented nearly from scratch with a few con/diverging interests: - letting the normative violent aspects of many current languages die gently - bridging language gaps between communities whilst not trying to pedestal any one language as perfect, and not trying to create one universal language (although flawed historical pursuits of this end are interesting points of reference) - radically accepting many different communication styles - deaf and non-verbal, trauma-informed, neurodiverse, gender and sex diverse - communicating clearly in <a href="storm.html">times of crisis</a> (e.g. battle languages)</p>
<p>but it’s not all perfect - in <em>Chants of Sennaar</em> it was really interesting to get peeks into the evolution of these languages and the feedback loop of cultures and languages diverging and alienating.</p>
<p>The battle language that <a href="Eris.html">Eris</a> designed for her <a href="Hope-Eaters.html">dogpack</a>doesn’t have any room for nuance to talk about their feelings - it’s all orders. It has two tenses: speaking as a master or as a dog.</p>

<p>silent stenographies translocuted up by <a href="Loqui.html">Loqui</a>.</p>
<p>the setting and its languages aren’t <a href="post-.html">post-</a>gender but I’m interested in what room for gender expression can be left when we can move on from the assumptions encoded in Latin languages (such as pronouns, tenses and relativistic/possessive language). <strong>how would you describe your dream gender expression without pronouns and stereotypes? what does it mean to be queer when there’s no word for it?</strong></p>
<p>it’s really taboo (and nearly impossible?) to use any <strong>othering</strong> language. this includes animacy - the spectrum of <a href="post-anthropocentric.html"><em>human</em></a> to <em>thing</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we’ve all got lots of secret names orbiting us</p>
</blockquote>
<p>people generally don’t know each others’ names (if they even really have names, outside of the ones used in these notes??), they know each other by a unique mix of new nouns, sometimes including the place-names of their community. they’re typically nouns that are like verb-er or noun-er, e.g. wanderer, boarder. some believe <strong>a name <a href="Hope-Eaters.html">tames</a> you.</strong></p>
<p>I wonder if this is a bare-minimum sentence form for everyday telephonic coordination, or if there could be more room for nuance: &gt; computer+dancer+Argyle visit us fix weathervane</p>
<p>nouns are gifts that people carry with them for a long time, they’re how they’re known in the world, so to force a noun on someone is very serious. its potentially a form of communal justice, a warning. fear the simplifier.</p>
<p>already noticing a way they could accidentally <em>other</em> each other, particularly wanderers like <a href="Rain.html">Rain</a>, by always saying a place-name (or place-less) and having to correct themselves when talking about them, just like when people make an effort to learn to use less gendered language :]</p>
<p>One alien word is <a href="asterasteraster.html">dreamt to them</a> that encompasses gravity and voice and song and destiny and influence in time and space and legacy and yearning.</p>
<p><strong>wishing for a new bedrock for language.</strong> (but there’s nothing new under the sun.)</p>
<p>exploring all the ways the ‘voiceless’ truly have voices of their own</p>
