# Doggerland
The [dogs](dogs.md) on [Mars](Mars.md) all eventually formed a big pack in their wanderings to find a place safe from the rising sea levels. Their collective confusion [wished](Monolith.md#wishcycle) for a continent from their ancestral memory, recollected from the microplastics in the northern hemisphere's oceans. The [megafauna](Menagerie.md) all find it to be a pretty homely place to act out [echosystems](echosystems.md). [Cephi](Cephi.md)'s there too, rollerblading along the staircase to the moon, with [Landfill](Landfill.md) on her heels! It took a lot of howling, but in the absence of [Deimos](Deimos.md) they've managed to coax [Luna](Luna.md) to come and join them, too.

I think dreams on Doggerland take place in the present on Mars or the past and future on [Earth](Earth.md).

[Scout](Scout.md) found itself on Doggerland, found [Loqui](Loqui.md) in a dreadfully simplified little black box. [The sky's full of wishes](skyfill.md). I had the agonising idea that in Scout's wanderings it would find more RAM for ⁕ and ⁕ would learn to parse all the loneliness it has projected into ⁕ and ⁕ would learn to parse ⁕ own feelings and do a lot more feeling-computing than a little echo-chip was ever designed to do (these idea makes me so sad, but I can't take them back). [Life's a beach and that no longer is an expression.](o--1.md)
