<h1 id="energy-for-ever-how-dreadful">energy for ever! how dreadful!</h1>
<p>I keep saying <em>post-solarpunk</em>, and I don’t mean to be cynical, I love solarpunk, but it’s complex. I’m interested in exploring the evil of humanity’s <em>myth of progress</em>, and that includes the exploitative nature of industrialised green energy (not that I don’t think solarpunk doesn’t already do this). But going further, exploring how progress is a self-enabling exploitation that’s always finding new enabling factors; new frontiers; new ways to build the machine.</p>
<p>Fossils being depleted doesn’t slow down industry, the machine just starts using planets as fuel. <a href="Monolith.html">Monolith</a> makes fossil time cease to mean anything, if your desire is for more history to burn, it can make that.</p>
<p><a href="saturnalia.html">wishing for a second sun</a> to increase solar energy production.</p>
<p>solar-panelled <a href="hermit.html">e-waste</a> that can never die.</p>
<p>At the <a href="storm.html">ends of worlds</a>, the <a href="eidolon.html">most lost folk</a> have unlearnt how to live any other way than exploitation, through <a href="ferrodoxy.html">religion</a> and symbiosis with <a href="Monolith.html">Monolith</a>. It has seemingly made fossils into a renewable resource, on a <em>naturally dead planet</em> that they think can just be wished back to life. I haven’t yet read any fiction that explores the ethics of terraforming, but that’s kind of what I’m getting at here, <a href="post-anthropocentric.html">post-anthropocentrism</a> on a planetary scale.</p>
<p>Also, on the smaller scale, people fucking love their waste machines. I don’t have the imagination to picture a future where we’ve untangled car culture from the technological. I’m not trying to predict the future with this setting, but I’m sure there’ll be <a href="biodiesel-bikies.html">biodiesel-bikies</a> on Mars.</p>
<p><a href="https://cmdx.itch.io" target="_blank">Cain Maddock</a> on WASTE EATER: &gt; I wanted to make something that explored my complicated relationship to solarpunk as a genre. On one hand, I think imagining what better worlds could look like is so incredibly important. We’re never going to get out of the whole <em>gestures broadly</em> situation we’re in unless we can make art that imagines the alternative. But on the other hand, I’m a sad bitch. I love writing tragic stories, especially ones that somehow manage to turn out well in the end. So I set myself the challenge of <strong>imagining a better world - and then zooming in on the person who’s having the worst time in it.</strong></p>
<p>I sometimes feel like the sun is setting on the solarpunk as a cultural moment because of aestheticisation. <em>hey Midjourney, give me a promo poster for my neo-folk gig in the style of that Chobani commercial.</em> but as a genuine ethical stance, I will always have <a href="Spring.html">hope</a>.</p>
