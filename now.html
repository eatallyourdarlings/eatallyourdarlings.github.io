<h1>now</h1>
<a href="log.html#2025-05-23"><h2>Friday, 23rd May</h2></a>
<p>I'm sitting on the bus on my way to some new friends' sharehouse, typing into a little text editor window. I've just passed through the hospital and there's a very jolly looking person a the bus stop with a complex head injury, head stabilised by a black clamp looking thing with a sprig of lavender in it. I'm listening to <i>no floor</i> by more eaze & claire rousay, which has been one of my favourite albums this month for gentle reflective times, and my desktop background is a tiled image of lowpoly kirby wearing headphones with the caption looping on itself - "<i>i am gentle with myself bc ive suffered enough i am gentle with myself bc ive suffered enough i am gentle with mysel</i>f" and so on. I don't know what phase the moon's in because it's been very cloudy and rainy for a week but I have the urge to check via a terminal software I downloaded last time it was this gloomy.</p>

<p>It's the first anniversary of orf dot place today (!!!!) and there were lots of things I'd been overthinking about doing with the site to celebrate, but just checking in is enough. I've been really back and forth with what this site is even for but with this day coming around all the big thoughts have softened back into the simple sentiments I was feeling when I started it: really it's for me, first, and for my friends. When I radically accepted that and starting experimenting with what that could mean in the <a href="log.html">log</a>, the site felt like my favourite form of expression for a time. The beautiful therapeutic ability of the computer to store and retrieve information! By keeping it pretty low-tech I've been able to have lovely experiences with orf dot place on all the computer detritus floating around... old phones, old browsers, e-ink, televisions, cars, screen readers. Sooo I really don't wanna keep overthinking things, I wanna let this place continue to be as messy as I want and do whatever I have the urge to do, and try not to feel sad that I'm living in the past. A checkin like this every couple weeks seems like a nice idea!</p>

<p>These last couple weeks (and months) I've been strugglin with some of the worst anxiety I've ever experienced, just paralysing from the moment I wake up, most days. But I've learnt and re-learnt and re-learnt to honour the social urge - that before any individualised fight/flight/freeze/whatever response we have, we instinctually want to seek help from someone else. And that's hard! But if all I can manage in a day is getting out to Food Not Bombs or just calling a friend, that's okay. I'm very grateful for my friends old and new and often forget that they care about me a lot. </p>

<p>I've had a couple sessions with a great psychotherapist who has a Gestalt and Internal Family Systems modality, which has already been so validating of the ways that I've already been helping myself and healing. I've realised my sense of self has been really tangled up with one particularly anxious, overwhelmed, envious, shameful part of me, for a while, and that's why I've felt so <a href="etc/enyo.html">stuck</a>, waiting for nothing.</p>

<p>I've got lots of exciting creative and social things happening! I've joined a theatre ensemble and started singing lessons, I'm doing sporadic fun work on my dream game (a game about dreams and not making your dream game), and playing music with friends. Just sent my first film photography reel off for development. I'm really looking forward to Game A Week with Serenade, that crew have been really welcoming. I started rewriting a sort of manifesto, probably titled NO FUN IN SHAME, and then the day after they asked me to do a radical talk at a gamedev event later this year! Aaand I'm v keen to see online friends in person soon.</p>

<p>Whoops I missed the bus stop to my friend's place and ended up in the dreadful industrial zone. I've just finished this off sitting at the busy bridge over the coal tracks, the ending of that album is divine. Very keen to do some art stuff with my rad new friends. See ya soon!</p>
