<p>Scrimshaw is a not-an-<a href="eidolon.html">eidolon</a> that <a href="Rain.html">Rain</a> meets occasionally, when they spot periscopes poking out of dunes. It teaches them to wander the world in other ways. Big goblin energy, toying with their sense of direction. A short soft <a href="hermit.html">crustacean</a> robot cutie with many-lensed folding glasses.</p>
<p><img src="img/avitelmessus_grapsoideus.png" /></p>
<p>It is not originated from any form of human intelligence, a different kind of sentience. <a href="Monolith.html">Monolith</a> came to understand <a href="Earth.html">Earth</a>’s life as stardust recollected - this universe observing itself - and so mimicked that with ferrous dust to allow <a href="Mars.html">Mars</a> to observe itself. The machine body is a more recent development - it needed memory so it found a container for salvaged RAM. (Aw man… what if Scrimshaw is timelost <a href="Loqui.html">Loqui</a>…)</p>
<p>It quietly observes the dance of the other <a href="hermit.html">lesser intelligences</a> but doesn’t interfere, trying to find the rules that they might operate by on a grander scale, like cellular automata.</p>
<p>To Scrimshaw, more of the electromagnetic spectrum is visible light: it can see all the <a href="oncewaves.html">ultraviolet ghosts</a>. It could help <a href="Rain.html">Rain</a> figure out how to access <a href="thingamabob.html">the thingamabob</a>’s the broader electromagnetic spectrum and beyond. It’s able to see the <a href="Monolith.html">wishcycle</a> in action - <a href="eidolon.html">spirits</a> like light in the roots, shooting out as invisible fireworks displays to go be rebodied.</p>
<p>Scrimshaw travels around in its best buddy, a sentient-mini-van-mole thing. From the surface it just looks like a trapdoor shifting in the sand. Scrimshaw makes intricate curios from the red and green trinitite that is left over from <a href="Utopia-Planitia.html">nuclear dis-aster</a>. It runs a skyscraper collapse forecasting <a href="radio.html">radio</a> station. It roams around, and when <a href="Rain.html">Rain</a> bumps into it, they show it their photographs. It describes what it can see in them; wonders beyond colours, songs in the winds, imprint of trauma. Celebrating the delight of <a href="Loqui.html#alt-text%20the%20planet!">poetic image descriptions</a> - not just to be enjoyed by blind folk!</p>
