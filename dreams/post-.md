It's *post-post-post-collapse-collapse-collapse*. I always wanted to have very little emphasis at all (writing-wise) on the *post-apocalypse* aspect of the setting. It's inspired by so many fantasy worlds that are so far post-something in a way that it's not really known by the characters, and not an important part of the present storyworld, like in *Dark Souls*, where its past cataclysms provide context to the present/incoming calamity.  Like in *Rain World*, collapse has been a cyclical constant in this world and its eco- (or [eco-adjacent](Monolith.md)) systems adapt.

[post-gender](language.md)? i love gender actually.... maybe it could be an element of the numbness everyone feels, an aspect of identity that *nobody* has the privilege to explore any more.
