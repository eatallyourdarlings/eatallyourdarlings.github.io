# we're all going to be eaten by giants far sooner than we thought. 

(o gosh this dream was fucked up)

A dreadful convergence; the slow yearning of a [cold sun](Sol.md) to be twinned again, accelerated by the desires of [forgotten-god-kings](forgotten-god-kings.md) for [perpetual energy](post-solarpunk.md) and [Monolith](Monolith.md) dissecting the gravitational memory of the system, altogether bringing about a repetition of *The Grand Tack*: Jupiter and Saturn's gluttonous swing through the nascent solar system that aborted [Mars](Mars.md) in the first place, coming back around to eat the rest.

idk what the timeline is, but maybe, ironically, tragically, Jupiter could be 'stably' twinned just in time for Sol to go supernova. for [Val](Val.md), in his timelost wanderings, to feel the winds burn away the last of his memory.

## so let's have a jig!
The terrible gravity of the giants has been known for generations by this merry troupe, and celebrated. Like a parallel to [Enyo](Enyo.md)'s unceasing dancers. Saturn's finally devouring all his kids! Hurrah! The first sacrifices for this *much brighter future*! An eternal Saturnalia!  *gas-giant, gastronomy, astronomy*, there's something there.

I picture a lot of rosy bums skipping around firelight, fauns and fairies. maybe this is to do with [Concrete_Forest](Concrete_Forest.md), or a nomadic troupe that passes through there, at least.
