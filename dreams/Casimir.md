# Kazi + Mirǔ
Kazi is a v angry [biodiesel bikie](biodiesel-bikies.md) and boywife to Mirǔ who is a centaur-thing from [Concrete_Forest](Concrete_Forest.md). 

they can do a crystal gem monsterfag fusion into Casimir, a wonderful role model for all the lost boys !!

Casimir is a masc, gallicized version of Polish name *Kazimierz*, derived from the Slavic element *kaziti* "to destroy" combined with *mirŭ* "peace, world". A powerful, potentially wonderful or dreaful name.

Mirǔ (Slavic); the word for world is peace. root-cognates (branching evolutions):
- mítos, “warp thread” - wyrding?
- mitrás “(that which) causes binding”
- “nice, gentle, mild”

> destroying the world as in destroying the known world as in any vestiges of anthropocentrism and imperialism and cisheteropatriarchy >:]

[Eris && Enyo](Eris-Enyo.md) are like *I need these twinks obliterated* - could wrap them around their fingers to raze [Utopaea](Utopia-Planitia.md).

Kazi is part of DEIM gang and there's a beautiful symmetry when [Sadar-Deneb](Sadar-Deneb.md) and [Deimos](Deimos.md) form an [asterism](asterasteraster.md). Duologies melt away - their spiritualities come from the same source  :]
