<h1>new ways to me</h1>

<p>for E :]</p>
<h2>words</h2>
<pre><code>
[verse 1]
you taught me a
new way to see.
poking at the 
bumps in the walls, like,
of course,
what else could they
have been?

horseshoe crab 
walking sideways on the tank
unseeing with its feet
the lazy gray paintjob
covering my 
imagined friends&#39; graffiti.

I&#39;m told these tanks are 
time vacuums 
and there&#39;s already been three 
cambrian explosions this week.
I wonder what they&#39;re looking for.

[chorus 1]
now a radio bird man&#39;s
burning through
the deserts inside my head
and I&#39;ve forgotten how to listen.

and I wonder if this graffiti crew&#39;s
turned into radio too?
let&#39;s bring antennae and listen in.

[verse 2]
trying to get
out of our heads
and in to the bird song
felt like I&#39;m bushwalking through 
a bad interview.

and I asked and I cursed you:
what else is in there with you?
cheeky little cognitohazard,
could I burn it with a horseshoe for you?
 
[chorus 2]
but a radio bird man&#39;s
burning through
the deserts inside my head
and I&#39;ve forgotten how to listen, again.

then a kookaburra
slammed into
the window above my head
and I remembered to listen.
(in kookaburra: [WATCH OUT THE FIRMAMENT IS EXTRA FIRM OVER HERE])

[verse 3]
vestigial memory;
my fingers got ahead of me.
I&#39;m still unlearning that instinct 
to put our love in public.

that familiar yearning
to be part of a nebulous scene 
(or just to be seen).

but it&#39;s strange to be perceived
in such high definition
that they can count our teeth.

now I&#39;m relearning how
and why
to keep a secret.

[chorus 3]
and the radio bird man&#39;s
burnt right through
the deserts inside my skull
and I&#39;m tired of listening to him.

but if I can just sit 
without eyes in my eyes 
then I can tune out the noise 
and start to learn 
a new way to listen.</code></pre>
