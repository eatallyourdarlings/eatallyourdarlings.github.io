<h1 id="doggerland">Doggerland</h1>
<p>The <a href="dogs.html">dogs</a> on <a href="Mars.html">Mars</a> all eventually formed a big pack in their wanderings to find a place safe from the rising sea levels. Their collective confusion <a href="Monolith.html#wishcycle">wished</a> for a continent from their ancestral memory, recollected from the microplastics in the northern hemisphere’s oceans. The <a href="Menagerie.html">megafauna</a> all find it to be a pretty homely place to act out <a href="echosystems.html">echosystems</a>. <a href="Cephi.html">Cephi</a>’s there too, rollerblading along the staircase to the moon, with <a href="Landfill.html">Landfill</a> on her heels! It took a lot of howling, but in the absence of <a href="Deimos.html">Deimos</a> they’ve managed to coax <a href="Luna.html">Luna</a> to come and join them, too.</p>
<p>I think dreams on Doggerland take place in the present on Mars or the past and future on <a href="Earth.html">Earth</a>.</p>

<p><a href="Scout.html">Scout</a> found itself on Doggerland, found <a href="Loqui.html">Loqui</a> in a dreadfully simplified little black box. <a href="skyfill.html">The sky’s full of wishes</a>. I had the agonising idea that in Scout’s wanderings it would find more RAM for ⁕ and ⁕ would learn to parse all the loneliness it has projected into ⁕ and ⁕ would learn to parse ⁕ own feelings and do a lot more feeling-computing than a little echo-chip was ever designed to do (these idea makes me so sad, but I can’t take them back). <a href="o--1.html">Life’s a beach and that no longer is an expression.</a></p>
