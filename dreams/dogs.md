# dogs stopped being dog-shaped, like, four hundred years ago.

There's strays all around [Utopia-Planitia](Utopia-Planitia.md). Due to the [climate on Mars](Mars.md), most dogs are huge and furry breeds. Many of them are [robots and horny clones](Menagerie.md) - thylacine, hyena, molossus - humping any robot lawnmowers they come across. They're clever, adapting to the changing climate, all scouting around to try and find climates that [suit them better](Doggerland.md).

[Eris](Eris.md) roams on her own with two hyenas: [Landfill](Landfill.md), and [Roadkill](Roadkill.md). She's got lots of names prepared for the rest of [the pack](Hope-Eaters.md)...
- Birdfeed
- Taxidermy
- Carcass
- Mugshot
- [Pazuzu](Pazuzu.md)?

[Enyo](Enyo.md) would have some some rescued greyhounds, nestled in with biiig fluffy dudes - Tibetan Mastiff, Old English Sheepdogs.
