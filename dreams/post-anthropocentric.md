# in the shadow of the Anthropocene, we will be fundamentally changed in ways we can't foresee.

the peoples' cultures and the [languages](language.md) they use are informed by spending generations in the long shadows of of two planets' worth of exploitative civilisations. trying to make sense of all the silly things we used to do. [where did we learn all this?](Earth.md).

I'm not just talking about anthropocentrism, here, though, really, but the implosion of all the ways that we are central to or seek to centralise ourselves in our own story. History, animism, cultural erasure, geocentrism/areocentrism, our very definition of life being upturned by [Monolith](Monolith.md) and [others](hermit.md).
