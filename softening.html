<pre>
I'll come back to it soon
and it'll be changed
because I'll be changed.

And there it is;
a softening.

I dove into the waves with a song in my teeth.
In my favourite place again
that I can always come back to.

You want to tell a story - 
but you want to save some for yourself.
<!-- (with an open chord) -->Don't too much.
What do you want to share, first?
Can you share less?
And less. And less. And less.
Now you're writing for yourself - almost.

I dove into the waves with a song in my teeth.

And there it was;
a gentle change;
a softening.
