<pre><code>
what&#39;s lost? what&#39;s found?
what&#39;s lost? what&#39;s found?
(whats, lost; whats, unfound)
what&#39;s fossed 
from this ossified ground?

could we rewrite our history
without saying &#39;our&#39;?
in terms that don&#39;t determine
how we will burn it?

how many singers silenced
before they earnt their -
before we learn their names?
(too many to count)

these subtle violents
in our everyday speaking.
can you talk of a thing
without saying &#39;it is near to me&#39;?

who&#39;s in my story?
lost songs, rejoining;
crushed by our terrible gravity.
a rejoinder; 
save what you - 
what is dear to me.</code></pre>
