<p>an absurdist <a href="Eris.html">Discordian</a> cult - post-military violent dancing troupe. all of its devotees are abducted as children and their tongues are cut out, so they speak <a href="language.html">nonverbal battle languages</a>. they are siblings in the manner of newborn turtles scrambling on a beach full of knowing that only a fraction of them will survive, feel a fleeting kinship. they’re not entirely beyond hope, if they can find solidarity in their collectivity, realise they’re othering, demonising, starving each other.</p>

With nerves and a healing heart <br />
Escapism creeps into our recipes</p>

<p><a href="Rain.html">Rain</a>’s unfound family, that they escape from at the beginning of their story. Rain may come to realise this when they visit other imperfect oases of freedom, and decide to try and disempower <a href="Eris.html">Eris</a> by undermining her supremacy, but they can probably do that on their own without Rain’s heroism!</p>

<p>(a recovered memory of a <a href="hermit.html">timid tamagotchi</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>this night we forked farther from the <a href="Valles_Marineris.html">mariner</a> and found an other <a href="forgotten-god-kings.html">archist</a>’s oubliette. if not for the airborne dust mingled with the defensive particulates, rendering them immobile, we’d already be dead. bless that uncanny charge dancing on undead air. as we dug through petabytes of offal, <a href="Eris.html">eris</a> sat on an old baron’s throne - baron still intact until he turned to a ferrous mist beneath her. she got <a href="Roadkill.html">roadkill</a> all riled up running through the clouds of killmites, its fur on end from the static, catching mouthfuls and puking them up at our feet. landfill played a slow game of magnetic fetch, once finding an uriron crown of three ravens. eris started to eat it and through bleeding lips barked orders that we’d have to fossick until she was finished with it. mostly junk data - offensively trash. a whole district just for shoddy orbital calculations of his saturnine satellite rentals, so many that it seems they had a catastrophic chain collision that created another ring. this gave eris a chuckle so she let me pick a part of roadkill to snack on, myself. i picked the tail this time, it had the least mites and it seemed to be the least bothered after i cut it off and grew it right back. </p>
<p>i hope the giant passes by again, our dreams were a bit damper and dancier when it was near. maybe if we’re close enough to a reef i can get caught in a wish. i can’t dream about that too loudly, though or it’ll be my turn to be the insomniac. we march on, deeper still.</p>
