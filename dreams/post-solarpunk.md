# energy for ever! how dreadful!
I keep saying *post-solarpunk*, and I don't mean to be cynical, I love solarpunk, but it's complex. I'm interested in exploring the evil of humanity's *myth of progress*, and that includes the exploitative nature of industrialised green energy (not that I don't think solarpunk doesn't already do this). But going further, exploring how progress is a self-enabling exploitation that's always finding new enabling factors; new frontiers; new ways to build the machine. 

Fossils being depleted doesn't slow down industry, the machine just starts using planets as fuel. [Monolith](Monolith.md) makes fossil time cease to mean anything, if your desire is for more history to burn, it can make that. 

[wishing for a second sun](saturnalia.md) to increase solar energy production. 

solar-panelled [e-waste](hermit.md) that can never die.

At the [ends of worlds](storm.md), the [most lost folk](eidolon.md) have unlearnt how to live any other way than exploitation, through [religion](ferrodoxy.md) and symbiosis with [Monolith](Monolith.md). It has seemingly made fossils into a renewable resource, on a *naturally dead planet* that they think can just be wished back to life. I haven't yet read any fiction that explores the ethics of terraforming, but that's kind of what I'm getting at here, [post-anthropocentrism](post-anthropocentric.md) on a planetary scale.

Also, on the smaller scale, people fucking love their waste machines. I don't have the imagination to picture a future where we've untangled car culture from the technological. I'm not trying to predict the future with this setting, but I'm sure there'll be [biodiesel-bikies](biodiesel-bikies.md) on Mars.

> I wanted to make something that explored my complicated relationship to solarpunk as a genre. On one hand, I think imagining what better worlds could look like is so incredibly important. We're never going to get out of the whole _gestures broadly_ situation we're in unless we can make art that imagines the alternative. But on the other hand, I'm a sad bitch. I love writing tragic stories, especially ones that somehow manage to turn out well in the end. So I set myself the challenge of **imagining a better world - and then zooming in on the person who's having the worst time in it.**

I sometimes feel like the sun is setting on the solarpunk as a cultural moment because of aestheticisation. *hey Midjourney, give me a promo poster for my neo-folk gig in the style of that Chobani commercial.* but as a genuine ethical stance, I will always have [hope](Spring.md).
