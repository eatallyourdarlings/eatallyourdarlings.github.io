<p>Look at us! We are not out of breath, our hearts are not in the least tired. For they are nourished by fire, hatred and speed! Does this surprise you? it is because you do not even remember being alive! Standing on the world’s summit, we launch once more our challenge to the stars!</p>

<p>The dynasties of rich men who styled themselves as god-kings and built <a href="Utopia-Planitia.html">Utopaea</a> are all forgotten.</p>
<p><a href="Val.html">Val</a> desperately doesn’t want to join them.</p>
<p>Their ridiculous (culturally appropriating, ugly, terrible for the health of coastlines, etc) tombs all lost to rising tides, or being weathered away by sandstorms. There’s lots of tomb-raider/grave-robber <a href="cast.html">characters</a>, particularly the <a href="biodiesel-bikies.html">biodiesel-bikies</a>, maybe even <a href="Rain.html">Rain</a> learns to be a looter.</p>
<p>one of the few ways that <a href="language.html">language</a> is othering, maybe, is referring to all these forgotten men as <em>’naires</em>. because of their exponential escalation of wealth, the average person can’t even conceive of how much money they had. trillionaires? septillionaires? <em>fuck those ’naires, we never had a use for numbers that big.</em></p>

<p>I don’t think he’d be mummified, no, he’d rather be frozen in the vacuum of space. In a satellite, or on a satellite, defiling her body. He’d keep his body in stasis but his brain alive enough to neuralink it to his dictator-terminator-body. The opt-out switch would malfunction and he’d end up as sentient scraps on a garbage island.</p>

<p><a href="Pazuzu.html">Pazuzu</a> was raised by one of these egomaniacs. Maybe each king had his own fucked up <a href="hermit.html">AI</a> best boy? Turning everything into an arms race, as they tend to do.</p>

<p>I bear an old name. It cannot be killed. They were my brothers and sisters and their names were immortal too but Titanomachy came and now those names live in me alone I think and think is what I do. - <a href="https://www.ishtar-collective.net/cards/ghost-fragment-mysteries#rasputin" target="_blank">Ghost Fragment: Mysteries</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We cannot characterize Rasputin’s strategic objectives and capabilities, cannot define its physical or computational architecture, cannot ascertain its disposition with regard to the City, and cannot be sure it retains memory of events before the Collapse. Perhaps what remains is only an autonomic shell, defending itself by reflex. Or perhaps Rasputin’s objectives have changed, transformed by some vital information it obtained during those dark days. - <a href="https://www.ishtar-collective.net/cards/rasputin#warminds" target="_blank">Rasputin</a></p>
