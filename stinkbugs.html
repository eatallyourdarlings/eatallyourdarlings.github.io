<h1>a waste of good stink bugs</h1>
<pre>
I counted two hundred forty three stink bugs
commingling in their lemon tree (like they own the place).
There's a natural repellent they could put on it, she told me,
liquorice extract or something or other
less biohazard more bad smell.

That could be exciting for the bugs, I thought;
taking a great big extended family trip to find a new treehouse.

There's a natural repellent we could put in our lemon tree,
I suggested, he shrugged off,
We've already bought insecticides so may as well use them.

"Imidacloprid kills two ways: systemic and contact!"

Insecticides, pesticides, 
those desensitised words.
We've a 'cide for everything.
Plurals of a prejudice,
auspices for this Plantationocene.

We're custodians of these chemicals, I thought, again;
"If not not now then when?"

I counted forty one stink bugs
upturned, poisoned 
in the dog-bowl-watering-hole
below our lemon tree (to own the place)
biohazard and bad smell, commingling.

I wish we were waste eaters.
