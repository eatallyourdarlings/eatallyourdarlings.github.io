            <p><i>Heroyam Slava</i> is a short documentary film about my friend Sasha's time volunteering in a refugee camp in Poland, helping kids displaced by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. It was directed by my partner Len and I was lucky enough to get to write music for it, which I am very proud of. I wrote a bunch of small motifs inspired by Sasha's stories, then Chloe the sound design wiz pieced them together.

            <p>I've put some old demos on <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/eatallyourdarlings">my soundcloud</a>, including soundtracks I've made for my friends' films for school. Most were made on Garageband on my old iPhone. I'm going to clean some of these up and share them here so I can take them off streaming (I'll probably use <a target="_blank" href="https://simonrepp.com/faircamp/">faircamp</a>). 
                If you really like any of the tracks on my soundcloud, please get in <a href="../contact.html">contact</a> and I'll send them to you for free so that you can listen to them offline and my tunes can have less of a carbon impact.</p>

            <p>I've put one janky little video game on the web, which you can play on <a target="_blank" href="https://eatallyourdarlings.itch.io">my itch.io</a>, but it may not work in your browser. 
                It's called <i>Little Guys</i> and it's a platformer about a witch in a wheelchair trying to navigate a treacherous path to a tea party. To do so they enlist the help of a couple magical little guys who help make the level more accessible for them.</p>
            <p>I tried studying gamedev at uni for a couple years but it super burnt me out so I haven't released anything since. I've been slowly working on personal projects and self-teaching.</p>

                <img src="masked-stinker.png" alt="A render of a 3D low-poly character, in shades of grey on a red background. A short, bone-thin masked figure stands slightly hunched, holding a dagger in one hand. Its torso is black and featureless with limbs that appear smokey, only half-there. Its face is a horned and pointy-noised porcelain mask, grimacing on one side and smirking on the other. The side that is grimacing has an open red eye in its socket while the other side has no eye in the usual spot; instead the eye is peering out from between its smirking lips. It has a drop shadow that looks like an open eye.">

                <br>made this guy in a haze at 1AM. it was my first time trying the #256fes challenge, which means making a tiny model with less than 256 triangles and an image texture with 256 pixels. modelled and rendered in Blender and then manually painted over with Bayer matrix patterns. Inspired by Raquel Meyers' concept of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.raquelmeyers.com/info_/">kybdslöjd</a>, it was a lot of fun doing the 'work' of a computer algorithm manually.

                <img src="newymation-invite.png" alt="A poster for a past meetup for digital artists in Muloobinba. It was created using PETSCII, the limited character set of the Commodore 64, in red and shades of grey. Most of the text is within ornate frames that evoke pop-up windows in a retro operating system, with cables connecting the words and frames to each other. The first window in the top left is a prompt saying 'Do you make cool stuff (animation, game design, 3D modelling, VFX) with your computer?', with the answer 'YES' powering a cable leading outside of the frame to the title of the meet and greet, NEWYMATION, styled after a neon sign. A bright red cockatrice is perched on the cables to the left of the title, as if leeching from the energy that powers the neon sign.">

An uninviting stone structure looms out of the dark, with an face-like structure at its entrance, composed of large stone hands. Four cupped hands make up its maw, with a ring of spread fingers resembling a mane behind it. Two more hands float above, connected at the wrists and glowing, resembling a demonic crown.">

                    <br>scrapped level concept for a 3D game jam, very much inspired by the Helping Hands of <i>Labyrinth(1986)</i>, which gave me nightmares as a kid. modelled and rendered in Blender, then dithered using 4x4 Bayer matrix algorithm.
