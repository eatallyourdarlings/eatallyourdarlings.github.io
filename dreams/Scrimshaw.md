Scrimshaw is a not-an-[eidolon](eidolon.md) that [Rain](Rain.md) meets occasionally, when they spot periscopes poking out of dunes.  It teaches them to wander the world in other ways. Big goblin energy, toying with their sense of direction. A short soft [crustacean](hermit.md) robot cutie with many-lensed folding glasses.

It is not originated from any form of human intelligence, a different kind of sentience. [Monolith](Monolith.md) came to understand [Earth](Earth.md)'s life as stardust recollected - this universe observing itself - and so mimicked that with ferrous dust to allow [Mars](Mars.md) to observe itself. The machine body is a more recent development - it needed memory so it found a container for salvaged RAM. (Aw man... what if Scrimshaw is timelost [Loqui](Loqui.md)...)

It quietly observes the dance of the other [lesser intelligences](hermit.md) but doesn't interfere, trying to find the rules that they might operate by on a grander scale, like cellular automata.

To Scrimshaw, more of the electromagnetic spectrum is visible light: it can see all the [ultraviolet ghosts](oncewaves.md). It could help [Rain](Rain.md) figure out how to access [the thingamabob](thingamabob.md)'s the broader electromagnetic spectrum and beyond. It's able to see the [wishcycle](Monolith.md) in action - [spirits](eidolon.md) like light in the roots, shooting out as invisible fireworks displays to go be rebodied.

Scrimshaw travels around in its best buddy, a sentient-mini-van-mole thing. From the surface it just looks like a trapdoor shifting in the sand. Scrimshaw makes intricate curios from the red and green trinitite that is left over from [nuclear dis-aster](Utopia-Planitia.md). It runs a skyscraper collapse forecasting [radio](radio.md) station. It roams around, and when [Rain](Rain.md) bumps into it, they show it their photographs. It describes what it can see in them; wonders beyond colours, songs in the winds, imprint of trauma. Celebrating the delight of [poetic image descriptions](Loqui.md#alt-text%20the%20planet!)  - not just to be enjoyed by blind folk!
