# Sadar (Sadr?) and Deneb
Two of the brightest stars in the North of [Mars](Mars.md)' sky?? I don't remember what the significance of these is or why they showed up in dreams, something to do with [Cephi](Cephi.md)'s name, Islamic(?) mythology, maybe peacocks. 

another set of [twins](twins.md), perhaps yearning for a [third](Sol.md).
