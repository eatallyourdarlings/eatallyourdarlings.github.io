    <h2>recalling a dream of Phobos falling, Autumn 2023</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Around the time I had the dream I was listening to<a href="https://emilyharpist.bandcamp.com/track/pitch-pedal-harp">Blue Pitch by Emily Hopkins</a> a lot.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I once had a dream that I was standing on Mars, looking up into
    the sky as one of its moons, Phobos, fell closer and closer towards
    me with every orbit. That dream-memory has always stuck with because
    of the raw and complex mix of emotions I felt looking up at the
    falling moon; dread, wonder, nostalgia and grief…</p>
    <p>Phobos crosses Mars’ sky twice every day, and gets closer by a
    few centimetres every day. In 10 million years, when Phobos gets
    close enough to be as big as Earth’s moon is in our sky today, it
    will start to gradually be broken apart by Mars’ gravity and turn
    into a ring. At (roughly) the same time the other moon, Deimos will
    have almost escaped Mars’ orbit and will hardly be discernible from
    the other stars in the sky. </p>
    <p>But before Phobos dies and Deimos leaves, if there are people on
    Mars at that time do you think they’ll look up at those bright
    specks in the sky and be reminded of home? And how will they feel
    later, when the night sky is just dust and stars?</p>
    <h2>process</h2>
    <p>In Autumn 2023 I had that dream and I dove into Blender to
    explore this image I had in my head, of a green Mars and a lonely
    moon. It was one of the first Blender projects that wasn’t just
    following a tutorial, and learnt a lot through trial and error. I
    found a height-map of Mars and learnt how to re-colour the texture
    using Shader Nodes. I also found a 3D model of Phobos, and projected
    onto it a photograph from <a
    href="https://beautifulmars.tumblr.com">BEAUTIFUL MARS</a>, which is
    a bottomless well of inspiration for me. I remember spending an
    unnecessary amount of time figuring out how much the orbit of the
    moon would have decayed in the far future, and whether Deimos would
    still be visible.</p>
    <p>I didn’t realise when I was starting out with Blender that the
    tutorials I was being fed by the YouTube algorithm were of a very
    skewed perspective: that 3D art is something that’s done with
    complex shaders and 16K textures (I wish I was joking) that take
    even the fanciest graphics card hours to render. When I had to leave
    this rendering overnight I didn’t feel great about it. The original
    version of this was a 120MB super-HD video loop rendered directly
    into Instagram reel’s aspect ratio—which is a bit of a sad indicator
    of my attitude towards my art at the time.</p>
    <p>In Autumn 2024 I sat down in a cafe for 45 minutes to re-love
    this work and shrink it down to fit my present values (on
    computer-art being nice when it’s small and therefore uses less
    energy). I opened the video file in Blender’s video editor and in
    the render settings I changed the frame rate from 30 to 1, which
    meant that only 25 frames of the original 750 would be rendered. I
    rendered each frame to my desktop cauldron, setting the output path
    to <code>Desktop/cauldron/#</code> so that each file would be named
    its frame number.</p>
    <p>Using <a href="https://github.com/makew0rld/didder">didder</a> on
    the command line, I tested individual frames with some different
    palettes and saturation settings. I’ve been using command line
    libraries for image stuff for a while but I’d been procrastinating
    learning how to write little scripts to run commands on a bunch of
    images in a directory, so I found an article and learnt how to do
    that in like ten minutes. I cast the following spell:</p>
    <pre><code>for i in *.png; do didder --input $i --output ./did/$i --palette &#39;#2c323a #734545 #51906c #639f98 #99ad62 #cfbd98 #c07b49 #ad5640&#39; --saturation 2 edm FloydSteinberg; done</code></pre>
    <p>… where <code>i</code> contains the name of each file in the
    cauldron ending in png, so using <code>./did/$i</code> as the output
    filename makes each of the diddered images go into the folder
    <code>did</code> with same name as the original. I used <a
    href="https://lospec.com/palette-list/dusty-rainbow-9">Dusty Rainbow
    9 Palette by Chase Stemel on LOSPEC</a> as a starting point for the
    colour palette. I opened all the frames with Aseprite to tweak the colours and render them into a
    gif.</p>
    <p>I choose a slow refresh rate for my gif art because I like to
    imagine them being displayed on low-power fantasy thingamabobs, like
    a chlorphyll-based e-ink colour screen.</p>
    <p>Thanks for reading this far! I hope you learnt something new or
    were inspired :]</p>
