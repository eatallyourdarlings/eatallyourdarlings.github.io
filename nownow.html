<h1>now</h1>
<p>remember to keep <a href="living.html">living</a>.</p>
<p>A Seussism: &gt; They sang: &gt; Oh, be faithful!  &gt; Believe in thy butter! &gt; And they lifted my spirits right out of the gutter!</p>
<p><strong>research</strong> can be concentrated, it can also be totally aimless, as long as you’re not overwhelming yourself too much.</p>
<p><strong>preparing</strong> - not taking for granted my current stable work/life situation. trying to get out of my comfort zone and make a gradual transition into moving away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i wish i wish i wish to let my past lie in gentle pastures.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>social</h2>
<p><strong>emails are lovely.</strong> don’t let writing emails to friends become a project.</p>
<p>make art for/with your friends!</p>
<p><strong>facilitating a radical reading and skill-sharing group</strong> in the form of a leisurely-paced email thread.</p>

<p>hosting movie nights, open mics in the community space?</p>
<h2>rest</h2>
<p>filling my life up with poetry, <a href="https://www.padraigotuama.com/" target="_blank">Pádraig Ó Tuama</a> being a constant grounding presence.</p>
<p>reading fiction!</p>
<h2>play</h2>
<p><strong>playing music first and foremost as a lovely, grounding habit, not a project.</strong></p>
<p>lots of little video games… - https://itch.io/jam/trans-joy-jam-2025/entries</p>
<h2>make</h2>
<p>computer-touchy creativity is not my prime creativity!</p>
<p>My life is the creative project, always churning in the background, that’s okay. Every day observations, reflections, practicing seeing and listening and remembering and feeling.</p>
<p>Making it up as I go.</p>
<p>experimenting with live-coding and MIDI software, excited for live.</p>
<p>mask-making with friends?</p>
<p><a href="onirisme.html">onirisme</a>: - practicing low-poly modelling, particularly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QoLorR9qpY" target="_blank">masks</a> - pixel-painting normals - a little messing with shaders</p>
<p><a href="whatnot.html">whatnot</a>: - sharing the music curation aspect with friends. - the playful javascript aspect of it can totally just be worked on based on impulse. - thinking about how the project could be collaborative. - seeking to make my research into DIY internet more social, co-learning in email groups, forums, meetups or calls with cool computer-touchers. - when it’s ready to share for more playtesting I’ll be more focused on the self-replicating self-contained server aspect of it.</p>

<p>[things on the backburner]</p>
<p>I guessss I would at some point like to have a page on my site that is a bunch of collected memos of these songs I’ve been writing, scrappy recordings brought together to see how they feel as an album. not too much of a project, I’m okay to share these songs before ‘producing’ them, I think.</p>
<p>trying to have a very lowkey presence on some not-too-awful social media platforms. not trying to make it into a big deal like this is my “grand return”. after being distanced from platforms for over a year, I’ve reflected a lot on my bad habits with them, and I am quicker to snap myself out of slipping into feeling parasocial/consumerist/attention addicted. letting myself enjoy having more avenues for being esoteric online and decentralising my creative output. maybe spreading some <a href="https://deathgenerator.com/" target="_blank">misinformation</a>. sharing snippets of gamedev and live music projects occasionally.</p>

<p>how I can find community that sustains my love of experimental electronic - https://sdmusicgroup.com/home Loukeman got a Discord ! - neo clowns? - soundcloud mutuals</p>
<p>how I can <strong>check in on and support artists that really fuel me</strong> at a healthier pace, rather than the occasional blitz through their feeds. particularly keen to learn 3D techniques from supporting Badru and theogramme. - http://patreon.com/MallBat - https://ritualdust.com/shop/ - <a href="https://bwusagi.gumroad.com/l/dlcei?layout=profile" target="_blank">“NEPEN” Zine PDF + Speedpaints</a></p>

<p><strong>THE LOCKUP COLLECT 2025</strong> - thinking about kybdsloyjd wood block emoticon friends inspired by PLATO. it’s gotta be a <strong>saleable work</strong> and I think what would excite me the most to want to make something to sell would be to sell something playful!</p>
<p>would like a bunch of small tools with make+bash to manipulate text files, e.g. deleting empty <code>&lt;path /&gt;</code> in SVGs, inserting the same <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> into every HTML file in a directory. saw some cool things like this already on murmuring.flowers, like a little script that seems to make an index of links, including broken ones.</p>
