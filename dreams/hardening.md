with all these [sad half-alive guys](Val.md) I'm questioning the inevitability of *hardening* processes - material, emotional. maybe *weathering* is a more appropriate word. what is lost in the pursuit of a perfectly preserved final form?

*on a meta-level, I worry that by hypertexting this world so much, the details of it will get so **set in stone** that I won't have enough room for imagining new things. hence why I don't want there to be too strict a canon.*

[Monolith](Monolith.md) is parasitising [the planet](Mars.md)'s slow systems; blurring geological *lifecycles* as we perceive them, distorting the line between lithosphere and biosphere and atmosphere and noosphere. Some [eidola](eidolon.md) have adapted to this strange new reality, gaining the ability to *petrify* with songs, or with light. Petrification accelerates [timescale](time.md), geologising in an instant.
