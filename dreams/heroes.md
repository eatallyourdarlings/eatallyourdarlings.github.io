# living other peoples' stories
through their relationship, [Cephi](Cephi.md) and [Rain](Rain.md) both come to realise how they were groomed into being heroes in other peoples' stories.

They're both a *tabula rasa* in a sense - Rain because of the way their trauma suppresses their memories, and Cephi by her moth-rebirth cycle. So they're very susceptible to the [dreams](dream.md) of others, in a time where it is believed that nobody can dream on their own anymore.
