# islands of kites swimming in interferent patterns
where all the wonderful ideas and [missed connections](oncewaves.md) go that never need to amount to anything. they can't help but congregate.

A mondegreen from Aldous_Harding:

But when it comes time to design it
I open up my kite
I'm a Pilot
```
