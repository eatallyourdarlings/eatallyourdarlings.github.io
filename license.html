<h3 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<p><strong>What is meant by ‘feminist principles’?</strong>
That is up to each person, collective or organization to decide. At the very least, it must have an aspiration to fight against cisheteropatriarchy and capitalism; and defend ecological, anti-racist, anti-capitalist and migrant justice positions.</p>

<p><strong>What is cisheteropatriarchy?</strong>
It is the system of social organisation that has the cisheterosexual men as the centre and measure of everything; establishing unequal power relations and oppression with the rest of human beings and nature.</p>
