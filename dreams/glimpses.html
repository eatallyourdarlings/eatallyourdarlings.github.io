<p>(each paragraph is its own thing)</p>
<p>dreams generally look scrapped together from a pile of digital waste - ruderal chaotic dreamgames. lots of stolen museum collections nuked into lowpoly like they’re. but also mixed media sometimes ?? 80s era puppetry (Dark Crystal, Never Ending Story), Marionettes, Claymation.</p>
<p>dusty vehicles stuck in 90-lane traffic. all riffing off that particularly ugly Australian aesthetic of prepperism, minivans so swollen with conveniences that they have a bigger impact than their holiday house and its chlorine fucking pool. but with like, a military and religious twist; all the burnt-out husks have faint filigree to indicate which caravan they held allegiance to. <a href="hermit.html">wandering hermits</a> keep the pilgrimages well paved through deserts of dead solar panels.nnicer vehicles manage to squeeze around them - pretty solarpunk (or <a href="post-solarpunk.html">post-solarpunk</a>?) stuff like from <em>Nausicaa</em>, Honora Mercier’s concept art for <em>The Shipyard</em> and Ailantd Sikowsky are all v inspiring. Kites, Sail-rovers, <a href="biodiesel-bikies.html">biodiesel bikies</a>.</p>
<p>It carry a lucky bone on a chain which changes its form when it’s not looking. It seek meaning in its shapes. Often it’s a tool like; knife, a key, a whistle, a compass.</p>

<p>his only audience is the tape recorder. a sure sign that the tradition is nearing its end.</p>

<p>The crank of a do-nothing-machine moves holes underneath an array of round stones, and below it is an array of bells. The stones are stacked up more or less in a cube. When viewed from above, it looks like an oscilloscope as the falling of the stones creates shadowy forms. The stones strike the bells until they run out, playing a short melody.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>mistrum is fierce, it sounds like maelstrom - a big storm. &gt; <em>I wonder how big a Fe-maelstrom would be?</em></p>

<p>A red salt pan desert, silhouettes of oil rigs on the horizon. In the shelter of a whale vertebrae, a figure is sat inside a makeshift driftwood tent, transfixed by an orange photon screen. Their shadow is long, and in it you can see the silhouette of a hyena, its eyes just catching the light, its teeth bared in a grin.</p>
<p>a horologist has constructed an orrery centred around Mars, with a different set of <em>astra planeta</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i keep notes about the times of today and yesterday <br />
i fold them up and send a paper boat your way<br />
and yet i still can’t reach you, i still can’t</p>
<p>the paper boat curves along the channels and the earth<br />
it conquers rock and waves and finally finds<br />
a quiet place to rest, along the edge</p>
<p>i search the sky for shooting stars to carry me to you<br />
or you to me, through a gentle breeze<br />
through this empty echo</p>

<p>In an overgrown plant nursery, a seedling latches onto <a href="Rain.html">Rain</a>, rooting itself in an artery in their arm. There’s a fire but Rain finds they’re able to breath through the smoke, the symbiote oxygenating their blood. Then able to breathe underwater, they’re exploring a town at the bottom of a dam. A lake so serene you wouldn’t even think what’s at the bottom of it. Later, Rain’s body is buried beneath a statue of a <a href="Rover.html">Rover</a> and as the rain finally falls for the first time, a small sprout of this plant grows.</p>
<p><a href="Rain.html">Rain</a> becomes an accidental parent of a giant silkie chicken.</p>
<p>Rox &amp;&amp; Lewin, T4T cowboys that own a bar! Rox is nonverbal, only communicates by chucking darts at a board without looking because they’re playing checkers against themself. “what’ll it be tonight love” - Lewin just interprets the dart throw based on how they throw it not where it lands.</p>
<p><a href="Cephi.html">Cephi</a> finds <a href="Rain.html">Rain</a>-<a href="Eris.html">Eris</a> atop an ice sheet, their bodies frozen intermingled in a dreadful violent dance.</p>
<p><strong>Eggbot</strong> jumps around the remnants of unmade dream games. A bipedal robotic mount that Rain used to escape Eris’ gang. Looks like the bottom half of an ostrich. Is very ticklish. It wandered off as Rain slept and got swallowed up by a big coal-eating worm, then rode in its belly pretty comfortably for a day and was regurgitated amongst a dusty forest of mining and network infrastructure. A great industrial crane animated by the spirit of an emu uncovered a fossilised egg and the bot understood it needed a place to keep it, safe from all the fossil-hungry automata. The bot takes up the egg in a birdcage with a little bell on the top, and the crane lifts the bot up in a larger cage. To escape the smoky industrial jumpscape they work together, like a precarious two-player 3D platformer. The egg probably ends up at The Menagerie, looking for an outback echosystem to hatch in.</p>
<p>having to follow the shade of the rib cage of a colossus to avoid the direct ultraviolet.</p>
<p>Val’s climbing out of <a href="Valles_Marineris.html">Valles_Marineris</a> under a cold red giant and Mars has formed a ring.  Lost in his centuries of regained memories. His perception of time changed he moves like stop motion. When he gets to the surface, a Monolith walking-cacti uproots itself and marches alongside him, like . His perception of sound is super warped too, he can hear the Doppler-effect of sandwinds passing him. The twin North stars, <a href="Sadar-Deneb.html">Sadar-Deneb</a>, are the brightest of the last lights in the sky, forming a supernova.</p>
<p>On a calm shore, Cephi witnesses Phobos break apart naturally and start to form a ring around Mars. </p>
<p>Eris is digging herself out of a pile of dusty corpses, then watching Deimos’ departure increasing in speed.</p>
<p><strong>graveyard orbits</strong> - a sky-splitter stuck in perpetuity, flits by each day like the silhouette of a sparrow, followed by a dreadful screeching. it never escaped its test flight. wished to go too fast. has become an orienting areological feature, but its latitude has shifted over generations, and its getting less stable.</p>
<p>the peoples each got fixated on their own guiding lights in the sky, and they each wished them brighter, but through their tele-mono-peri-scopes they didn’t noticed the other stars shifting luminance, too. <a href="Sadar-Deneb.html">Sadar-Deneb</a> is going supernova, <a href="Phobos.html">Phobos</a> is blinding, <a href="Deimos.html">Deimos</a> is dimming, and Saturn and Jupiter have been <a href="saturnalia.html">dancing closer together</a> for generations.</p>
<p>tunnels inside a damn. cave divers amongst concretions/vertebrae/roots.</p>
<p>A little terminal thingamabob where each character is just an xyz location and train of thought; an intent; a dream; a feeling. three numbers and a string: &gt; another planet I try to map it &gt; no user interface &gt; it won’t escape me again</p>
