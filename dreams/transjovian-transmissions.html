<p>The pre-collapse music industry was centralised around the four major Jovian moons, with the major players having a moon each for their machinations. Their transmissions are peaking in their complexity and weight, having been encrypted more and more and more over the centuries, mainly as a security measure against competitors. (Following the trajectory of the technological arms race of consumerism.)</p>
<p>Pirates are always working at cracking new encryptions, of course, but not too hard, as among the lesser known moons and farther flung asteroids, the older ways of telephony are being remembered. Music wants to be free! There’s so much old tech in graveyard-orbits, ready to bootstrap your own <a href="radio.html">radio</a> show.</p>
<p>Signals that have escaped the industrial silos are collected by <a href="Enyo.html">martian archivists</a>!</p>
<p><a href="hermit.html">Loqui’s friends</a> are stuck in cryptofascomputers in Europan ice running AARM1024, turning the ’bergs to steam.</p>
<p>Transjovian tunes drop out often because of the constant auditory IP monitors.  cops run supercomputers to detect IP violations and pirates run supercomputers to find legal loopholes to resume playing. A new wave of hypnagogic pop sweeps Callisto for a day which has huge dropout pauses in the music, reminiscing on times when the lawyer LLMS were so slow it would take 20 seconds for copyright claims to resolve and the music to resume. Bitrates of streaming increase exponentially to accomodate for the dropout/resume rate. </p>
