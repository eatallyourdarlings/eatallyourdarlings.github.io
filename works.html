    <p><i>yearn</i> is my first web poem, with a little bit of interactivity. 
    <br>The background image was made with a tiny <a href="./tools/dither.html">dither</a> tool. 
    <br>You can view a plain-text version of the poem, <a href="yearn.txt">yearn.txt</a> (300 bytes compared to the above's 300kb). </p>

    <p><em>three d-words on a moon</em> is my first Bitsy game. <br><q>after a long journey through the lonely void of space... you've finally pinpointed the source of your gender envy to this gay little moon.</q></p>
    <p><em>Little Guys</em> is a platformer about a witch in a wheelchair trying to navigate a treacherous path to a tea party. To do so they enlist the help of a couple magical little guys who help make the level more accessible for them. It's the first game I finished, it's pretty janky and might not work in your browser.</p>

    <p><em>Heroyam Slava</em> is a short documentary film about my friend Sasha's time volunteering in a refugee camp in Poland, helping kids displaced by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. It was directed by my friend Len and I was lucky enough to get to write music for it, which I am very proud of. I wrote a bunch of small motifs inspired by Sasha's stories, then Chloe the sound design wiz pieced them together.

    <p>The demos include soundtracks I've made for my some more of my friends' films. Most were made on Garageband on my old iPhone. If you really like any of these tracks, please get in <a href="contact.html">contact</a> and I'll send them to you for free so that you can listen to them offline and my tunes can have less of a carbon impact from streaming.</p>

        <img src="img/masked-stinker.png" alt="A render of a 3D low-poly character, in shades of grey on a red background. A short, bone-thin masked figure stands slightly hunched, holding a dagger in one hand. Its torso is black and featureless with limbs that appear smokey, only half-there. Its face is a horned and pointy-noised porcelain mask, grimacing on one side and smirking on the other. The side that is grimacing has an open red eye in its socket while the other side has no eye in the usual spot; instead the eye is peering out from between its smirking lips. It has a drop shadow that looks like an open eye.">

        <br>Made this guy in a haze at 1AM. It was my first time trying the #256fes challenge, which means making a tiny model with less than 256 triangles and an image texture with 256 pixels. modelled and rendered in Blender and then manually painted over with Bayer matrix patterns. Inspired by Raquel Meyers' concept of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.raquelmeyers.com/info_/">kybdsl√∂jd</a>, it was a lot of fun doing the 'work' of a computer algorithm manually.

        <img src="img/newymation-invite.png" alt="A textmode poster in red and shades of grey. The text describing the time and date is within ornate frames that evoke pop-up windows in a retro operating system. A prompt says 'Do you make cool stuff (animation, game design, 3D modelling, VFX) with your computer?'. The title of the meet and greet, NEWYMATION, is styled after a neon sign. A bright red cockatrice is perched on the cables to the left of the title, as if leeching from the energy that powers the neon sign.">

        <br>Made with <a target="_blank" href="https://lvllvl.com/">lvllvl.com</a>, using PETSCII, the limited character set of the Commodore 64. This was for NEWYMATION, a local artist meetup, featuring a fearsome rendition of <a target="_blank" href="https://theroostcreative.com.au/">The Roost</a> mascot.

        <img src="img/hellhands.png" alt="A low-res render in black, white, yellow and shades of red. An uninviting stone structure looms out of the dark, with an face-like structure at its entrance, composed of large stone hands. Four cupped hands make up its maw, with a ring of spread fingers resembling a mane behind it. Two more hands float above, connected at the wrists and glowing, resembling a crown.">

            <br>Scrapped level concept for a 3D game jam, very much inspired by the Helping Hands of <i>Labyrinth (1986)</i>, which gave me nightmares as a kid. Modelled and rendered in Blender, then dithered using 4x4 Bayer matrix algorithm.
