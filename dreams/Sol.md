# our Sun is missing a twin or two

E told me that Sol used to have a twin :[

> when stars die dont they become hyperdense and lose their glow and develop an inescaple gravitational pull? sounds like crushing loneliness to me idk

**Solar souls** - organisms that were closer to the point of creation have a better understanding that all souls come from Sol, and recognise their *sol mates*. 

Souls are bonded in threes:
- an actor
- an observer
- a chronicler

So as an example from [pre-history](Doggerland.md), a strong triad would have been a bond between:
- a pre-human (e.g. Neanderthal)
- a megafauna 
- a beetle

Maybe their consciousness is distributed between them, on some level. They all have an [asterism](asterasteraster.md) that they see each other in :]

Sol's yearning for a twin leads to a repetition of gravitational history.
