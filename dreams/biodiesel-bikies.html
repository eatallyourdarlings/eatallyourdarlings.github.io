<h1 id="pho-deim">PHO &amp;&amp; DEIM</h1>
<p>a note in my phone, circa 2021? that brought me so much joy: bikie gangs vs centaurs</p>
<p>PHO &amp;&amp; DEIM are two biodiesel bikie gangs, with rival allegiances to the moons. they’re post-military warmongerers with obsessed with the Roman Empire (hahaha)</p>
<p><strong><a href="post-solarpunk.html">post-solarpunk</a> revheads.</strong> totally ripping off <em>The Cars That Ate Paris</em>, imagining an alternate history for that aesthetic that’s like solarpunk but totally missing the point.</p>
<p><strong>full of spite.</strong> they fuck with each other’s <a href="radio.html">signals</a> for no good reason, they’ve actually got pretty complementary tastes in music, but they wouldn’t know.</p>
<p>PHO gang are scrap-heapers from the nuclear waste labyrinth and DEIM are city-side sky-bikies. kiteriders, perhaps.</p>
<p>they’re bad anarchists, fetishising chaos whilst actually raging against it. in an arms race to find a technical solution to the problem of the moons and the climate (that will be resolved by letting gravity do its thing) they’re making the situation a lot worse. maybe DEIM can find allegiance with <a href="Eris.html">Eris</a>, scouting out the gravitational weapons of the city and its underground, to find something to kill <a href="Phobos.html">Phobos</a>.</p>
<p>DEIM are marginally more prejudiced than PHO, the latter being a mix of bots and flesh-havers. maybe both gangs unite in their prejudice against the centaurs of <a href="Concrete_Forest.html">Concrete_Forest</a>, if <a href="Nuckelavee.html">Nuckelavee</a> becomes a real problem, but they take it too far, of course. If they can be helped to reflect on the unity of that culture’s joint faith in <a href="Sadar-Deneb.html">Sadar-Deneb</a>, they can reflect on the futility of their dualities and maybe conjoin their gangs to help build more stable networks.</p>
