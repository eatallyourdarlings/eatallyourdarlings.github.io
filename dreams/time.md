# time doesn't care about you

Every body's perception of time is fucked in part because of trauma; exacerbated by the way that [Monolith](Monolith.md) can inhabit these feelings; the fact that they all [dream together](dream.md), that chemical/geological time has become ungrounded, at the whims of their wishes. 

Things are really *off* for humans who've only every known [Mars](Mars.md). Days are ~25.5 [Earth](Earth.md) hours. They feel especially disconnected because of the infrequency of the moons orbits, which have drastically changed over generations. [Old ways](Luna.md) of telling time don't make sense any more.

Days being called [*sols*](Sol.md) feels kinda areocentric. A return to [antiquated beliefs](ferrodoxy.md)  that they're the centre of the universe?

Years could be told by the rough time until it is believed that [Phobos](Phobos.md) will impact the planet and [Deimos](Deimos.md) will slip its orbit, in the format `-49, 990, 090`. The exact year that the story takes place has been lost to time, but this doomsday clock has taken on more of a spiritual significance, contributing to the feeling of existential dread.

[Enyo](Enyo.md) watches a literal doomsday clock still ticking down past zero and into the negative.


what's that phenomena where the climate creates a crazy bright day? did I imagine that?
