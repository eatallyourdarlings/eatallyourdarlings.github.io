# every body is a bit traumatised

the world and story is mapped out by these characters (most often literally, through their [dreams](dream.md)). So I know nothing of the world that they can't know, or will know. Ironically, I've at times tried to define these characters by their trauma, while I think that's exactly what all traumatised folk are trying to escape.

I don't think they'd be known or referred to by the names or pronouns that I use for them in these notes - there's a lot of nuance to [their languages](language.md).

I think of them as **actors** all trying to disentangle their selves from stories written for them by other forces. [Monolith](Monolith.md) is making sense of all these conflicting stories that yearn to join.
