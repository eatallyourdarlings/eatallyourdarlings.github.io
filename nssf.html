    <h1>normalise sharing scrappy fiddles!</h1>
    <p>a mantra/movement from Lu/Luke Wilson (A.K.A. todepond), who has an amazingly open creative practice.</p>
    <p><strong>sharing scrappy fiddles</strong> is sharing the ongoing process, the incomplete things you’ve worked on and maybe don’t feel amazing about, but will very likely feel better about if you share them a bit before they’re “ready”.</p>
    <p><strong>normalising</strong> is when you make it more socially acceptable to do so. it’s the most important part of this mantra.</p>
    <p>This page is a scrappy fiddle! I’m still thinking about and learning how I can do this, in solidarity with my lovely friends.</p>
    <p>If you’d like to share a scrappy fiddle but don’t know where, please <a href="contact.html">email it to me</a>.</p>
    <p>I don’t think we should put too much thought into what <em>the point</em> of sharing is. Just emphasise the <strong>normalising</strong> and see what the benefits of sharing come to be. I know that I’m a lot happier whenever I’m supported in sharing scrappy fiddles, feeling like I have friends who will be receptive to that and maybe even reciprocate with their own.</p>
    <blockquote>It is up to you whether you share yourself or not. But whatever you choose to do, whether you share scrappy fiddles or not, you <strong>must</strong> <em>normalise</em> sharing scrappy fiddles, at the very least for those who want to or have no choice, like me. You are a scrappy fiddle. You may or may not share scrappy fiddles. But you must normalise sharing scrappy fiddles.

    <p>Recently I shared a scrappy fiddle poem with a friend and found that after reading it out I was actually seeking a bit of feedback on it to figure out why it wasn’t quite flowing. My friend really helped with just a few words, saying that my genuine expression was coming through in some of the weird wording. Then she shared a scrappy fiddle song with me, and didn’t solicit any feedback, so I didn’t give any, besides “you’re amazing” or something. Sharing a scrappy fiddle might not turn out as lovely as this, often. In many situations you might find yourself getting unsolicited feedback for things, anyway, so maybe part of normalising sharing scrappy fiddles is getting comfortable with that.</p>
    <p>A few friends have said that maybe sharing scrappy fiddles isn’t suited to everyone’s creative practice, giving examples of people who go into isolation and come out with a beautiful complete work, or saying that the part of their creative process where they’re quietly polishing something to perfection is the most fulfilling, or that they appreciate the pressure that a high standard of quality can put on their process. I think these are all valid! I’m not trying to convince these people otherwise, but just to show, by example, that <em>scrappiness can lead to happiness</em> and that it can only be <strong>normalised</strong> with support.</p>
    <p><em>People want your scrappy fiddles!</em> One dear friend recently put years worth of “unfinished” beats up on Soundcloud after being pressured by his friends and family who just desperately want to hear what he’s been up to. I think it’s made him very happy to do that, and they’re all bangers.</p>
    <p>I don’t think I’m really normalising sharing scrappy fiddles yet, but I’m trying. I’ve been putting things in the <a href="log.html">log</a> and sending them to friends, and a few have reciprocated, which is very exciting.</p>
    <p>I am a scrappy fiddle, I am a work in progress.</p>

    If sharing scrappy fiddles was easy, then we wouldn’t need to normalise it. <em>When</em> sharing scrappy fiddles is easy, then we will have finally normalised it.

    <blockquote>Your strategy for normalising sharing scrappy fiddles might involve leading by example / becoming a role model, but it doesn’t have to. You could do it in so many other ways. I won’t patronise you by listing some examples. You’re creative enough to figure it out yourself!
    <br>Okay fine I’ll list some examples.</blockquote>
    <ul>
    <li>If you share a lot of scrappy fiddles but you don’t support others in sharing scrappy fiddles then you are failing to normalise sharing scrappy fiddles.</li>
    <li>If you share scrappy fiddles and make out that it’s really special and tricky and unusual and stuff, then you are not normalising sharing scrappy fiddles. You are making it worse!</li>
    <li>If you don’t share scrappy fiddles but you emotionally support those who do, then you are normalising sharing scrappy fiddles.</li>

    If you ever do— ever get to the end of an artistic project, you end up with an <strong>artifact</strong>. But that artifact is not the project and the project is not the artifact. The artifact is only the final step— a shadowy echo of what you <em>really did</em>. It can be important— meaningful, but only within the bigger picture within your struggle towards the <strong>end</strong>. If you were to discard all of that initial work, you would lose something valuable— something precious.

    <blockquote>
    The process is the point! That’s the human part! That’s why we’re here! To share our journeys and struggles with each other! Otherwise we’re no better— we’re no better than some stupid— if you want an artifact— without the process we are nothing better than a stupid image or language model pumping out— regurgitating any— if you want an artifact— that’s not why we’re here.
