<p>a scrappy single-page zine made in an afternoon that I‚Äôve been dropping into friends‚Äô mailboxes.
archived here with some extra links and stuff. I thought about sharing a pdf of the original online, but I think I‚Äôll just let it do its own self-replicating zine thing in meatspace.</p>
<ul>my intentions with this zine are:
<li>trying to bring community together to devote ourselves to creativity and mutual support. inspired by recent conversations with dear friends around filling the atheist holes in our hearts with something lovely and regular (enough).</li>
<li>trying to <em><a href="nssf.html">normalise sharing scrappy fiddles</a></em>.</li>
<li>encouraging slow communication via email. texting everyone all the time can be overwhelming! I made a new super secret special email with proton<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> that I‚Äôm only sharing with friends for this purpose.</li>
<li>putting weird manifestations out there, knowing (hoping) that the right (weird) people will be receptive to it.</li>
<li>sharing a really sweet playlist and encourage others to do the same!</li>
</ul>

‚ô° COPYLOVE ‚ô°
please copy!
copying is an act of love.
share this with a friend?
reprint it and put it in third places?
</pre>

<p>(first two pages were left intentionally blank for you to draw something cute!)<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<hr />

<p>are you a creative person? (I think so! or you could be.)</p>
<p>would you like to have something regular to do with people, creatively? (me too!)</p>
<p>I‚Äôd like to start something!</p>
<p>I think <em>Sundays at Sunset</em> sounds like a nice time to devote to something good.</p>
<p>It can be at my place, or yours, or a secret third option.</p>
<hr />

<p><b>you don‚Äôt need to know a damn thing!</b> let‚Äôs improvise!</p>
<p>a jam is parallel play, accessing and giving love to our inner children.</p>
<p>just bring along your beautiful self, plus maybe an instrument or your chosen art medium.</p>
<p>there are many things that we can only learn together.</p>
<p>we can make up our own secret languages.</p>
<hr />

<h2>keep it scrappy!</h2>
<p>Lu Wilson has this mantra that I‚Äôm very fond of:</p>
<blockquote>NORMALISE SHARING SCRAPPY FIDDLES!</blockquote>
<p>It‚Äôs when you help make it more socially acceptable to show-and-tell half-baked creations, finding the fun in the process rather than focusing on your perfect creative <em>artefacts</em>.</p>
<hr />

<p>You are a scrappy fiddle. You may or may not share scrappy fiddles.</p>
<p>maybe the world would be better for it, if you helped to normalise sharing scrappy fiddles by at least supporting others who‚Äôd like to do it.</p>
<p>wouldn‚Äôt it be joyous to have a place (physical and digital) to share all the things we do? we could have an email thread full of ideas and sketches and ‚Äúunfinished‚Äù poems and little audible morsels and eat them all whole.</p>
<hr />

<p>this zine is scrappy! I made it in no time.</p>
<p><em>scrappiness can lead to happiness.</em></p>
<p>I‚Äôve had so many sketches and ‚Äúdemos‚Äù collecting dust, but when I started to think of them as memos<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> instead, and sharing them with people, I‚Äôve been a lot happier.</p>
<p>I would love to see/hear/read your scrappy fiddles!<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<hr />

<h2>manifesting&hellip;</h2>
<p>really I‚Äôm just desperate to make more cool stuff with cool people, and trying to attract those who are my type of weird.</p>
<p>I can‚Äôt do this on my own!</p>
<p>Please reach out if you would like to help facilitate regular jams. We can keep things small and improvisational, this doesn‚Äôt need to be a huge deal.</p>
<hr />

<p><em>Imaging a space where&hellip;</em></p>
<p>everyone feels comfy singing.</p>
<p>(if we‚Äôd like to) we can all go apeshit dancing, thrashing, screaming, scribbling.</p>
<p>we‚Äôre all amateurs, always.</p>
<p>we‚Äôre all teaching + learning + making.</p>
<p>it‚Äôs lowkey and easy and there‚Äôs no pressure to turn up weekly.</p>
<p>we can focus on fun first, trying not to imagine an audience.</p>
<hr />

<p>BUT WAIT - who am I? (realising I forgot to introduce myself). I‚Äôm Olive, a trans dyke who loves to drum, sing, play guitar and make weird little things with my computer.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been writing songs for a while on my own and I‚Äôm itching to start a band and do more parallel-play visual art.</p>
<hr />

<h2>nine songs to know me</h2> all these songs are from artists and records that mean a lot to me!</p>

<p>a playlist can just be a list, we don‚Äôt need platforms to share music! ‚ù§Ô∏é</p>
<p>(I downloaded these all from Bandcamp or with yt-dlp üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è)</p>
<p>I could ride my bike to you and give this playlist to you on a USB, that‚Äôd be fun.</p>
