<p>caroline are an 8-piece band from London. their 2022 debut album is an all-time favourite. they composed <em><a href="https://youtu.be/7H8svevRVkM?si=ZFDCCfPwAAUwhJOJ" target="_blank">Bergensbanen</a></em> collaboratively in pandemic isolation and in production was the first time hearing all of it together. they perform in a circle and they all sing, often just one or two chords back and forth with little snippets of lyrics, iPhone memo interludes, played back through a distorted amps in giant halls.</p>

The right time
I don't even know if I'm alive
(Know the right time)
But I don't wanna be somebody else
(At the right time)
Maybe I don't wanna be anyone
(At the right time)
I don't wanna be somebody else

The right time
I don't even know if I'm alive
(Know the right time)
But I don't wanna be somebody else
(At the right time)
I don't wanna be anyone
(At the right time)
I don't wanna be somebody else

How many are they?
I never told them
(Tell me, I never knew that)
Sink down, unfolding
(Tell me, I never knew that)
Don't go, I'm holding
(Tell me, I never knew that)
Press on, press on him
(Tell me, I never knew that)
Two times I told them

Now, I know your mind
Now, I know your mind
