# I dreamt of a mourning moon

Deimos is leaving Mars - at about the same rate that [Phobos](Phobos.md) is hurtling towards it. Moons gone :[

I really like the worldbuilding convention/trope where the mythos of different cultures compliment or contradict one another, and when studied reveal a grander story (of the past or the future). The [concrete folk](Concrete_Forest.md) revere something grander—as in on a grander scale in time and space—than the [sisters](sisters.md)' faith in the moons.

Could Deimos' exit trajectory leads it to [Sadar-Deneb](Sadar-Deneb.md)? Could the [Monolith](Monolith.md) intuit this trajectory and use it to spread from Deimos to another particular star system? [Why this system](asterasteraster.md)?

[Eris](Eris.md) has faith that Deimos shining alone in the sky will mark her recreation of utopia for humanity. [Enyo](Enyo.md) knows it will leave. The [eidola](eidolon.md) (as an extension of [Monolith](Monolith.md)) have hope for where it will end up.
