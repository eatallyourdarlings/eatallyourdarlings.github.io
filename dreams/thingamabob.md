[Rain](Rain.md) navigates [Mars](Mars.md)' uncanny psychogeography with the help of a thingamabob inhabited by [imaginary friends](Loqui.md) and they bootstrap functionality onto it with the help of [Scrimshaw](Scrimshaw.md) and others.

DXing is searching for [radio](radio.md) broadcasts far away. They don't transmit anything themselves, just listen in. Most DXing happens at night because sunlight effects radio propagation. **At sunset, DXers search for signals from the east - at sunrise, the west.** At midnight, signals from all directions can be heard but interference is high.
