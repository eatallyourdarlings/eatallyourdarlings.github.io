Earth seems to be mostly forgotten by the Marsfolk. hope it's doing better. the waste eaters and [garbage islanders](gnome-island.md) will be okay.

[the storm](storm.md) is a lossy mimesis of this world they never knew, [wished](Monolith.md#wishcycle) back from their ancestral memory.

## whatnot beach

a handful of wyrd dreams took place on a low-poly plastic beach, following [Scout](Scout.md)(?) collecting [mnemonic paraphernalia](curios.md). It's been around so long the plastic has turned to fine imitation-sand. The oceans are stilled - [Luna](Luna.md) couldn't stand to make waves further circulating plasticks in her oceans, so she left. When you walk in the shallow shores, the ripples are mirrored in the beach. A [misremembered continent](Doggerland.md). Why are there so many cicadas here?
