"What else can you do with your body?"

When I quit the troupe that calls this 
body home
it will welcome
in slower things
or rejoin
the slower things
I often forget it once was.

In the shorter term
(if I have any say in it)
whilst it's still 
resembling me
I'd wish that it not cease its wandering
when it's home to one less wonderer.

It could be gifted to gentle handlers
to disaggregate, peel, dissect, reseal, respectÂ 
in salts and plastics and sketchbooks.
How many tertiary students it may traumatise,
I'm morbidly curious, but secretly hoping
that my unravelling can sensitise them,
more than anything.

But most ideally,
before it's dust in the whitewash,
I love to imagine my cadaver dancing.

I'd wish it stolen and shored up
by pseudoscientists, or
artists or playwrights or taxidermists or activists
or whatever other
word you'd use
for those curious animals
who can recall for me
more nuanced words than animacy.
