<p>the peoples’ cultures and the <a href="language.html">languages</a> they use are informed by spending generations in the long shadows of of two planets’ worth of exploitative civilisations. trying to make sense of all the silly things we used to do. <a href="Earth.html">where did we learn all this?</a>.</p>
<p>I’m not just talking about anthropocentrism, here, though, really, but the implosion of all the ways that we are central to or seek to centralise ourselves in our own story. History, animism, cultural erasure, geocentrism/areocentrism, our very definition of life being upturned by <a href="Monolith.html">Monolith</a> and <a href="hermit.html">others</a>.</p>
<p>they don’t know what to do with the intricate technological instincts left over in their hands.</p>
<h2 id="solastalgia">solastalgia</h2>
<p>an emplaced or existential melancholia experienced with the negative transformation (desolation) of a loved home environment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the 1980s onwards, under the combined impacts of coal mines, power station pollution, and persistent drought, the people of the Upper Hunter were suffering from a form of chronic distress that seemed to me to be the opposite of topophilia. Their relationship to their home environment had turned bad. It was this thought that inspired me in 2003 to create a new concept for the English language, one that captured this feeling of chronic distress caused by negatively perceived changes to a home and its landscape. I realised that there was no concept in the English language that adequately described the distressed state of the Upper Hunter residents. As a result of my own background and the testimony of citizens in the Hunter region, I defined “solastalgia” as an emplaced or existential melancholia experienced with the negative transformation (desolation) of a loved home environment. Solastalgia is fixated on the melancholic, but it is also a foundation for action that will negate it. There is a positive side to psychoterratic classifications, one where positive earth emotions and feelings such as <a href="http://healthearth.blogspot.com.au/2011/09/creating-language-for-our.html" target="_blank">biophilia, topophilia, ecophilia, soliphilia and eutierria</a> can be used to counter the negative and destructive. Either we face a pandemic of solastalgia and related negative psychoterratic syndromes as a result of the havoc created by unsustainable development and climate change, or we use our intelligence and creativity to give rise to a world where our positive psychoterratic emotions can thrive.</p>
