<h1>license</h1>
<p>All original content on <b>orf dot place</b> and anything else that links to this page is licensed under the Feminist Peer Production License, unless explicitly stated otherwise, allowing fair use under the following terms. This excludes photographs depicting myself (Olive) or my friends &mdash; please don't circulate those without my permission because that would be weird.</p>

<h2>preamble</h2>
<p>The human-readable license text below was copied from <a href="https://labekka.red/licencia-f2f" target="_blank">labekka.red</a> on 2024-01-04 and slightly edited by me (Olive), with an added preamble and an explicit mention of ecocide.</p>
<p><b>Why this license?</b> I believe in the vital importance of the cultural commons as something that can help us transcend the division of labour, and I rebel against the absurd concept of intellectual property. This copyfarleft license allows cooperatives and solidarity-based collectives organising under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecofeminism" target="_blank">ecofeminist</a> ideals (or similar, e.g. solarpunk), but not corporations, to exploit cultural works for capital gain. It is a fork on the original text of the Creative Commons Non-Commercial license (CC BY-NC-SA) to make it explicitly anti-capitalist.</p>
<!--<b> In simpler terms: <b>you can make money from my stuff if you're not a capitalist wanker</b> -->
<p><b>How would you like to be credited?</b> With a short link to this website, <code>http://orf.place/</code> as well as the date of retrieval (plus some nice words if you'd like). Also feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me with any questions and maybe even <a href="support.html">support</a> me if you're feeling extra nice?</p>

<h3 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p><b>What is meant by feminist principles?</b> That is up to each person, collective or organization to decide. At the very least, it must have an aspiration to fight against cisheteropatriarchy and capitalism; and defend ecological, anti-racist, anti-capitalist and migrant justice positions.</p>
<p><b>What is cisheteropatriarchy?</b> It is the system of social organisation that has the cisheterosexual men as the centre and measure of everything; establishing unequal power relations and oppression with the rest of human beings and nature.</p>
