<h3>bitsy!</h3>
<p>biased opinions from cecile:</p>
<h3>main bitsy</h3>
<ul>
<li>bitsy 8 onwards is… annoying to use :( too many features that bloat the UI and are weirdly prescriptive (looking at the sfx and music tools specifically lol). it also doesnt play nice with certain <a href="https://github.com/seleb/bitsy-hacks" target="_blank">hacks</a>, which is why i’d go with any version before 8. 7.2-7.7 probably the best with hacks.</li>
<li>i think if you want to do funky things with audio files then you’re def going to look into hacks! the least annoying way to work with hacks is using <a href="https://aloelazoe.itch.io/bitsy-savior" target="_blank">bitsy savior</a>, where you only need to add your hacks to your html once and then it does the patching for you as you update your game, so you can test the game With Hacks easily instead of the vanilla way of editing your bitsy -&gt; downloading the game -&gt; adding the hacks -&gt; testing the game. a bitsy update last year made it incompatible with this tool, which is another reason why you’d want to use an older version of bitsy</li>
<li>“lots of dialogue that progresses as two characters move together” can def be done and i can think of several ways of doing it, but because of the limitations of bitsy the characters will necessarily have to stop moving before entering dialogue mode.</li>
</ul>
<h3>hacks with main bitsy</h3>
<p>from what youve described the hacks i’d recommend are: - <a href="https://github.com/seleb/bitsy-hacks/blob/main/dist/bitsymuse.js" target="_blank">bitsymuse</a>, which lets you handle a whole bunch of audio files as you wish. i’ve used it for games like HOPE and i am still here. it’s good. there is even a tool that candle made that makes applying it to your bitsy html game super easy: https://kool.tools/bitsy/tools/bitsymuse-ui/ - literally any of the hacks that start with <code>dialog-</code> lol but honestly you can read through the list and figure out which one could be useful for your project ### forks - the most powerful bitsy fork is probably <a href="https://kool.tools/bipsi/" target="_blank">bipsi</a> because you can just script your own custom hacks without leaving the editor, the other forks seem to mostly borrow the same editing style and structure as main bitsy, which means they essentially keep the same design constraints–not a bad thing, its just up to you to decide what you want from your game - there is a fork of bipsi itself which uses ink, <a href="https://smwhr.itch.io/binksi" target="_blank">binksi</a>, i havent used it BUT could be interesting? ultimately i think any fork is probably as good as the other, it all depends on what you want to make, and what fits your workflow more (to an extent)</p>
