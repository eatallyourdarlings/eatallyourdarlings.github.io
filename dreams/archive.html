<p>vaguely remembering a a wyrd western text-adventure game idea, where you played as a <a href="twins.html">brother and sister</a> in parallel, chapter by chapter. <em>waystations</em>. they fit somewhere in the canon, I’m sure.</p>
<p>The Wendigo story I wrote at age 16(?). I was incredibly inspired by the sentiment of a person being so othered, starved, isolated that they turn to cannibalism. There was some haunting aspect to the stories I read, as well, like the forests they hunt in embodying their revenge. I was trying not to appropriate the story because the <a href="simplifier.html">simplification</a> of the Wendigo into just a hybrid-zombie-man in pop culture is tragic. I dreamt of a great unbreaking thunderhead following a lost child, it was shaped like a skull that couldn’t decide on its taxonomy, would keep morphing into shapes more fearful, branching and then converging, like a speculative evolution for an animal that evolved purely to terrify. Lightning antlers, too many canines. This is maybe a nascent idea for <a href="CARRION.html">CARRION</a>, when it was an eldritch being or gaiaform.</p>

In their fossicking of <a href="radio.html">the radio desert</a>, they never yet suspected why facing west always yielded dead air - devoid of signal or noise. At times when the wind turned east, they could smell that death, too. The space between the wanderer and their <a href="Eris.html">pursuer</a>; that dead air could taste the chase.

<p>narrative ramble ??</p>
<p><strong>DOADP</strong></p>
<p>The game begins with Rain dreaming of the first manned trip to Phobos, when Val awoke the monolith and changed the moon’s orbit. They’ve dozed off on the early morning’s watch,   and are woken by a friend talking on the radio. </p>
<p>In the museum area Rain can find an old exhibited detailing the early history of human settlement on Mars, with diary excerpts from the first small colony in Utopaea Planitia. They recorded huge seismic events beneath the planet’s crust, within their lifetime saw the ice caps begin to melt. </p>
<p>Throughout the game Rain finds records that tell the story of Dr. Petra’s research team, centuries-gone scientists who ran experiments involving the monoliths all across the region.</p>
<p>Petra reports that she and her team experience dreams similar to those that Rain experiences while resting at monoliths.</p>
<p>Their research spans a number of years, and they report that the contents of their dreams gradually change over time. </p>
<p>As they conduct more invasive experiments on the monoliths, their dreams become more disturbing, and they all begin hearing a voice in their restless sleep.</p>
<p>Petra reports that she can no longer get far enough away from the monoliths to have a restful sleep, and starts writing about them resentfully. In her private notes she ruminates on the idea that they form a network with roots running deep into the planet. That her research would need to delve deeper than any human on Mars had before - to the depths of Valles Marineris, the Argyle Sea, to caverns below Ares’ Spine.</p>
<p>In the ‘Stone Sanctuary’ Rain finds reports of Petra’s teams attempts to find the source of the voice in their dreams. They uprooted the monolith in the stone sanctuary, and Val was able escape the Plane and inhabit a nearby construct. </p>
<p>Val joined Petra’s research team, guiding their research into the Monoliths, providing a lot of insight into their nature. </p>
<p>He recounts his conversation with a being that told him of the planet’s coming doom. </p>
<p>Their shared nightmares increase as their experiments involving monoliths continue. They have awoken the Carrion. Its dreams spread through the broken monolith in the Sanctuary, inhabiting the large war machines and lashing out. </p>
<p>Petra’s team flees on a warship with the broken monolith to Valles Marineris, setting up the laboratories in the underground city where Val resides at the time the game is set. </p>
<p>One member of the team volunteers to kill theirself to try and replicate the experience that Val had - pulling their spirit from the Plane into a vessel.</p>
<p>At this point the team have become exiles, no longer associated with any government body after the incident at the Sanctuary. </p>
<p>They conduct this experiment in secret on the farthest shore of the Argyle Sea.</p>
<p>As they near the end of their natural lives, all members of the team undergo this conversion, transferring their souls to machines.</p>
<p>They experience recurring nightmares as the years go on, and members of their team go missing or suddenly lash out, becoming animalistic.</p>
<p>Petra hypothesises that this is a problem with memory space in their new bodies, and she and Val begin experimenting with offloading memories.</p>

<p>old, pale blue whales sail  through the salt pan desert. weary, lost feet pierce that veil sowing the dying red planet.</p>
<h2 id="section-4">2022-04-12</h2>
<p>setting the scene ( how hard do i go on the space magic ? )</p>
<p>The planet <a href="Mars.html">Mars</a>, an unknown number of centuries in the future. After the awakening of the ancient <a href="Phobos.html">Phobos</a>, it burst with seeds that rained down and gradually sprouted all over the planet. This awakening drastically accelerated the moon’s descent towards Mars, and years are counted in roughly how long <a href="time.html">until it impacts the planet</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="Monolith.html">Monolith</a> accelerated the rate of human settlement on Mars by terraforming the planet - repairing the planet’s magnetosphere and atmosphere to an Earth-like state within a century. People came to revere it and develop new spiritual beliefs based around them, and it was believed that more miracles would be granted from their worship.</p>
<p>Burying the dead around these monoliths would lead to them being able to come back as (known as <a href="eidolon.html">eidolons</a>) and often find their spirits clinging to machines and inhabiting them (usually by accident). However, machines aren’t suitable hosts for their spirits. Their bodies eventually turn into the strange stone/iron material that the <a href="Monolith.html">Monolith</a>’s bark is made up of, and they are trapped in this shell. Eidolons have to change bodies regularly to avoid this fate. The reasoning for this is that when bodies are buried in the roots of monoliths, they become part of a collective consciousness within their root network. When they escape this network to find a machine body and rejoin the material world, they inevitably <a href="hardening.html">petrify</a> and that stone shell grows into a new branch of the network.</p>
<h3 id="present-day">Present day</h3>
<p>The game is set long after calamities throughout the solar system drove humans to near extinction, and most remaining humans are raised on myths of the blue planet they came from.</p>
<p>There is a looming threat of great and violent machines that come wandering out from <a href="Utopia-Planitia.html">Utopia Planitia</a> - the capital city and site of the greatest <a href="storm.html">calamity</a>. These machines spread a frenzy to others and through cannibalism and through the spiritual network of Monolith. In this frenzy they are joining the <a href="CARRION.html">CARRION</a>: a parasitic egregore within the collective consciousness that embodies humanity’s self-destructive nature. At the time that the game is set, Mars is violently re-dying. In some regions the atmosphere has thinned so much that radiation, cold or lack of oxygen will kill you. There is an unbreaking thunderhead over the city, the oceans are increasingly violent as <a href="Phobos.html">Phobos</a> gets closer, and deadly sand storms are a regular occurrence.</p>
<p>Humans that have survived move mostly in nomadic groups, divided by their conflicting beliefs. Some hidden, peaceful settlements remain, and they stay connected via <a href="radio.html">radio</a> and other telephony. Among these groups are;</p>
<ul>
<li>a pair of warring factions who worship Phobos and Deimos,</li>
<li>a clan of scavenger <a href="eidolon.html">eidolons</a> who worship the twin stars <a href="Sadar-Deneb.html">Sadar-Deneb</a>,</li>
<li>sand pirates who build great vehicles and machines of war,</li>
<li>a cult named the <a href="Hope-Eaters.html">Hope-Eaters</a> led by <a href="Eris.html">Eris</a>, a sadistic conqueror.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="Eris.html">Eris</a> believes that the stories of <a href="Earth.html">a blue planet</a> with <a href="Luna.html">one moon</a> are a <a href="prophesy.html">prophecy</a> that she is meant to fulfil—that Earth never existed and they have to create that perfect planet for themselves. Eris’ ‘children’ are all abducted from peaceful settlements that they raid. They each have their tongues cut out and are raised to be dispensable, selfish scavengers.</p>
<p><a href="Rain.html">Rain</a> is a young adult who escapes the <a href="Hope-Eaters.html">Hope-Eaters</a> under the cover of night to forge their own path in the lands surrounding <a href="Utopia-Planitia.html">Utopia-Planitia</a>. They are driven by their reoccurring vivid <a href="dream.html">dreams</a> that get stronger the closer they get to the city. They are very quickly thrust into danger and get lost in unknown lands but are able to find some safety in small hidden settlements established by others who fled other violent groups. They could follow the guide of <a href="Val.html">Val</a>; to play the <a href="heroes.html">hero</a>—stopping <a href="Eris.html">Eris</a> and the <a href="CARRION.html">CARRION</a>—but can ultimately choose their own path.</p>

<p>an avatar or shell is/was a juryrigged mechanical body for an <a href="eidolon.html">eidolon</a>, but maybe that’s just what an eidolon is. maybe Rain-rebirth is foreshadowed by some fucker measuring them up for a new body. (thinking of the Spider Undertaker from Rango).</p>
<p>forms <a href="Val.html">Val</a> and <a href="Frej.html">Frej</a> have taken, respectively. at this stage they were maybe <a href="Rain.html">Rain</a>’s grandparents??</p>
<hr />
<p>When they switch bodies from their robot forms to their drones (animals) they transfer their whole consciousness, therefore if they’re ever killed, their mind dies too. </p>
<p>The transferral to and from the owl: Avatar is graceful and quick, and can be done on the fly. The owl lands on the body of a decrepit robot slumped against a dead tree, the light fades from the owl’s eyes and brings to life the centuries-old automaton.</p>
<p>The Avatar stands up as the light fades from the owl’s heart and needle claws. The owl falls from its shoulder, and is caught in the cradle of the avatar’s left arm, severed at the wrist. It inspects the owl’s lifeless body for a moment; stretches and counts its feathers, wipes sand from its eyes, then raises its head to meet your gaze. Its eyes glow with the same colour that the owl’s had moments before. Vocal chords that likely haven’t been used for eons croak: “Hello, Rain”</p>
<p>The human brain is limited by the capacity of its Avatar, therefore the process of retrieving your grandma’s mind from the Wyrm is not as elegant as the Owl. It involves baiting the Wyrm with a flare, then tranquillising and tearing out the brain unit.</p>
<p>Freja has a sort of robot-dementia from being stuck inside the Wyrm’s limited capacity for so long </p>
<p>Val has selectively compartmentalised his memories and written records, to be unlocked with Decryption Keys</p>
<p>Encrypted logs are sometimes written, sometimes a literal train of thought, poetry, schematics, maps… most result in some kind of upgrade for the protagonist. </p>
<p>He did so during the nuclear war to hide sensitive information from enemies. He’s aware of all the encrypted data but not able to remember why he did it, believing that the world has moved on and all he can try and do is provide a safe haven for bots, he never tried. But the corruption leads to the destruction of all his backup bodies, so now he needs your help to destroy the source of it. He got especially desperate and had to destroy the obelisk in the Hunting Grounds, which is now the only place he can find new bodies to tinker with and replace his current one. It’s incredibly dangerous for him to venture there because there isn’t an obelisk nearby - he can only risk short trips. He may have actually done more harm than good by destroying the obelisk there. He compares it to ‘cutting off his own gangrenous legs just to prolong the infection’s spread to his heart.’</p>
<p>His belief was that the corruption source lied at the heart of his underground city, but upon your arrival you realise that was stolen by the Empress. He holds one of the last few uncorrupted obelisks.</p>
<h2 id="tharsis-rising.">Tharsis Rising.</h2>
<p>or, The Shogun of Tharsis Basin (2016)</p>
<p>a short story I wrote for English class at age 14 that was the first seed of an idea for dreams_of_a_dead_planet. At the time we were learning about Japanese Feudalism in ancient history class, and I spent most classes half-listening while I explored Google Mars. I’m pretty sure I was also reading the Hunger Games around that time.</p>
<p>I’m very grateful for my English teacher Mr. David Evans who greatly encouraged me, saying that he very easily pictured this story as a graphic novel. He mentored me for a bit in my final year of high school, at which point I was trying to decided whether I wanted to go into writing for video games or graphic novels. We mostly just spent our meetings talking about Hellboy.</p>
<p>maybe I’d like to integrate this story into doadp in the form of a distant childhood memory for <a href="Rain.html">Rain</a> or <a href="Eris.html">Eris</a>, mingling in <a href="dream.html">dreams</a>. replacing the feudalist themes with the terrorism of the <a href="Hope-Eaters.html">Hope-Eaters</a> and <a href="Val.html">Val</a>.</p>
<h3 id="transcript-edited">Transcript (edited)</h3>
<p>Two hours before sunrise, our Sector is awoken by the blaring horn that signals the arrival of a message from the Tharsian Shogun. Before they arrive, the streets myst be cleaned, the stage in the centre of town must be put together and above all I must be prepared to hold the welcoming ceremony for the party. I slip down from my bunk, noticing that my father still hasn’t returned after last night. I begin preparations for my performance to welcome the .</p>
<p>When I leave my room there’s a familiar figure sitting at the bottom of the steps. He turns to me and his eyes light up - meeting me with a grin that’s missing a number of teeth. In the artificial lights of our front yard his hair looks as orange as the sand. His face has a number of freckles that would normally take a farmer years to earn.</p>
<p>“Niko!” he shouts, then drops his voice to a whisper and says - “do you have any idea what the Shogun’s business is with our Sector?” “It’s too early to speculate, Alec,” I say. “Help me get ready for the ceremony.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Alec applies the last of my makeup, then pulls out a dusty mirror for me to check it. He’s transformed me once again into a porcelain doll. The itchy ring of blue clay on my forehead represents the rising sun from which the Shogun claim their heritage.</p>
<p>All of the artificial lights in our Sector are switched off - a sign for the townspeople that it’s time gather at the atmospheric checkpoint and witness the party’s arrival. Across the red dunes we spy two tall silhouettes on the horizon, the blue rising sun at their backs. I hear Alec let out a sigh of relief - it appears only a small party has been sent. As they near the checkpoint, it becomes clearer that they do not bring a message of peace. Astride their two-legged robotic mounts, the messengers drag between them a chain of four people bound by their necks and wrists. As they are dragged closer, I see that they’ve each been fitted with ceremonial death masks; grisly iron cages made to demonise them. The Shogun’s punishment for rebels - marked for execution.</p>
<p>As the party pulls up short of the checkpoint, I notice that while the two soldiers are fitted with standard oxygen masks, the death masks are not so airtight. The curved tusks and horns are all capped with fine mesh, allowing oxygen to escape at almost the same rate it is fed in - keeping them all on the verge of suffocation.</p>
<p>Still on the outside of our town’s artificial atmosphere, one of the soldiers reaches out a beckoning hand. The townsfolk all rush to put on their own makeshift oxygen masks and stampede through the checkpoint’s airlocks. The soldier drops from their mount to the sand, tugging on the chain and forcing the prisoners to their feet.</p>
<p>tbc.</p>
<p>“they were conspiring to assassinate the shogun last night” - first one is revealed to be alec’s older sister - last one is protag’s father - they rush forward, but are kicked down to the sand and almost black out - come to focus on the face of their father, turned purple, lying in the sand facing them</p>

<p>asserts how few chances the actors have to affect canon.</p>
<p><a href="Rain.html">Rain</a> gets one chance at these, and if they die, like a choose your own adventure, they wake up as if from <a href="dream.html">a dream</a>, but the time has passed.</p>

<li>heading into <a href="Utopia-Planitia.html">Utopia-Planitia</a> before Rain-rebirth</li>
</ul>
<p>in dreams_of_a_dead_planet, each journey takes place in the same finite amount of time (say, a couple weeks?). the canon only allows for so much influence within this time. if you miss chances you find yourself falling off of dead-branches and losing time.</p>
<p>Old ideas are in the lossy past in the timeline.</p>
<p>Many cultures share mythology about an Otherworld that is accessed beyond waking and beyond death.</p>
<p>maybe the <a href="eidolon.html">eidola</a> didn’t start showing up until recently. CARRION’s confused effort to manifest itself into more long-lasting forms. their apparent age is a facade, an echo, they age in reverse.</p>
<p>Scout wanders the places that I can’t go - places missed; dreamt; deleted; lost. It can visit people I can’t, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESjMCvNV8AM" target="_blank">my good buddy Professor Snail</a>.</p>

<p>in my earliest dreams, <a href="CARRION.html">CARRION</a> was a cosmic horror crossing space and wandering into the real through everyone’s nightmares, making them realise that they were all visiting the same place when they dreamt, and that they didn’t even begin to know how to defend it. I imagined Rain’s brief visit to this gentle plain to confront it.</p>
<p>An underworld, netherworld, realm of the dead, home of deities and spirits, <em>Orbis Alius, the Otherworld or Afterworld</em> is a common concept in mythology. In many cases an old man has to transport souls across a <a href="Argyle.html">body of water</a> to be granted access to the realm. Spirits are thought to travel between worlds, or layers of existence in such traditions, usually along an axis such as a giant tree, a tent pole, a river, a rope or mountains.</p>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_dreams_(mythology)" target="_blank">Land of dreams (mythology) - Wikipedia</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Irish Mythology has many interesting names for its Otherworld, including: - <em>Tír fo Thuinn</em> (“land under the wave”) - <em>Tír na mBeo</em> (“land of the living”) - <em>Mag Argatnél</em> (“the silver-cloud plain”) - <em>Mag Ildathach</em> (“the multicoloured plain”) - <strong><em>Mag Cíuin</em> (“the gentle plain”)</strong></p>
<p>The Irish Otherworld is reached by going under the waters of pools, lakes, or by crossing the western sea, by entering ancient burial mounds or caves, or an otherworldly woman may invite the hero into the Otherworld by offering a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Branch" target="_blank" title="Silver Branch">silver apple branch</a>, <strong>or a ball of thread to follow as it unwinds.</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes the hero returns after what he believes is a short time, only to find that all his companions are dead and he has actually been away for hundreds of years. This matches with my earliest ideas about <a href="Val.html">Val</a>…</p>
<h3 id="blah">blah</h3>
<p>every resource (chemical, gravitational, spiritual, cultural, emotional, teleological).</p>
<p>In <a href="archive.html">archive</a> I often referred to Monolith as obelisks, an anachronism from a time when I was playing a lot of metroidvanias and imagined them as pretty much just video-game-trope-magic-powerup-macguffins, like the trees in <em>Ori</em>. Monolith’s branches are definitely not just that any more! But maybe this <em>wishing</em> framing could be a fun framing for granting <a href="Rain.html">Rain</a> violent ‘endgame abilities’, for players who desire to be <a href="heroes.html">the hero</a></p>
<p>For lost centuries, Val’s soul wandered the Afterworld, until he was fished out and trapped in a machine by a team of researchers - including <a href="Frej.html">Frej</a> and Petra. He was the first <a href="eidolon.html">eidolon</a>, maybe.</p>
<p>Medusa-Fossae fits pretty well with my idea to have gorgon-like enemies that <a href="hardening.html">petrify</a>.</p>
<p>The story being set here represents the destructive hope of humanity leaving behind their <a href="Earth.html">home planet</a> in the hopes of creating a new utopia. Centuries after humanity nearly destroyed itself again, many of the surviving factions of humans are scrambling to reclaim these terrible technologies and rebuild that idea of Utopia from the top down, a doomed pursuit.</p>
<h3 id="eris-playlist">Eris playlist</h3>
<p>songs for when <a href="archive.html#Phobos%20is%20gone.">Phobos is gone</a> and it’s just Eris. in a dark time, I thought; <em>Get The Dutch</em> is the main theme to this story, and maybe that could still be true; the soundtrack to her story as her despair becomes her.</p>

<p>to reward the player’s violence and further desensitise them, <a href="Rain.html">Rain</a> will be positioned to mirror heroes of legend; - as corny-ass Achilles wielding a petrifying aegis after conquering the whole colosseum at the heart of <a href="Labyrinth.html">Labyrinth</a>.</p>

<p>insofar as it is possible to ‘do a permacomputing’ i would like to do a permacomputing with this game. I’m not building on military tech. whether that means creating a 3D game engine from scratch built on top of a virtual-machine with its own opcodes, or just targeting an old emulator/abandonware, idk. it warms me to imagine people implementing the virtual machine on a different computer and then you can run the game.</p>
<p>work in the open as much as possible - no, as much as I’m comfortable with - in a way that preserve secrets, because this game is mostly about secrets. not open source, not closed, a secret third option. <strong>open source secrets</strong> - maybe there’d be a secret branch, mirrored to a different git host, where the only diff is less directories in .gitignore. maybe that’s just for me.</p>
