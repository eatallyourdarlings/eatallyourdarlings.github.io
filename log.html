went for a ride with words caught in my teeth:

  actually longer but shadier and calmer
  lost in your streets
  guess I'll be following these signs
  a lot more this year
  asphalt smiles in the ground
  grounding
  found myself to a paved pedestrian path
  like the good little electrode I am.

slowed down to gauge sentiments glaring off my sunnies:

  you are
  extremely
  hot and
  dangerous
  tell your dog I
  said hi

<p>I showed up at my friends' woodwork studio to see if I could lend a hand, and spent a lot of time taking photos of the various curios and textures around the place. I think I kinda loaded them with the expectation that I'd collage them into something Really Cool, and I don't love the result. Maybe the process I went through was just not very inspiring&mdash;lots of automation with command-line software&mdash;or it didn't leave enough room for intention. Felt like I was just pushing pixels around for 45 mins until I was sick of it. Here it is, anyway, in the interest of sharing scrappy fiddles or something. I can always come back to it, of course.</p>

<p>two years ago today I sent this scrappy recording of one half of <em>Gatekeeper</em> by Feist to a new friend I'd made, who has a beautiful singing voice.

I'm a more confident singer now and it was fun to duet with myself, anyway. it'd really warm my heart <a href="contact.html">to hear</a> your scrappy take on this song (yes, you, hello friend, I'm sure you've got a lovely singing voice, but no pressure xo).</p>

It was starting to get not fun, so I put on a nice colourful outfit, went to the garden and picked some strawberries with a neighbour and her granddaughter. I came back fresh-brained and cracked the resizing algorithm. In a bookshop on a rainy afternoon, a friend wandered in just as I was polishing it off. She took a reverse-selfie to try it out, quickly uncovering bugs, which I quickly fixed.</p>
