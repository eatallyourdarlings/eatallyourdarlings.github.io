# sad old unicorn

A wandering albino elasmotherium (a puppet or clone from [Menagerie](Menagerie.md)). It's particularly sensitive to the melancholies of the [cast](cast.md) and they are sometimes able to find a bit of comfort and common ground sitting and singing with it. It, echoes [birdsongs](oncewaves.md) with them.
