    <p>worked a little more on <a href="tools/dither.html">a little dither tool</a>. I'm enjoying doing a little bit of coding in my pyjamas each morning. It was starting to get not fun, so I put on a nice colourful outfit, went to the garden and picked some strawberries with a neighbour and her granddaughter. I came back fresh-brained and cracked the resizing algorithm. In the bookshop on a rainy afternoon, a friend wandered in just as I was finishing polishing it off. She took a reverse-selfie to try it out, quickly uncovering bugs, which I quickly fixed.</p>

    <p>(<a href="https://deathcrash.bandcamp.com/track/duffys-4" target="_blank">with an open chord</a>) don't do too much.</p>
    <p>Words bounced around my head all day. I thought about putting them down here, but gave them some time instead. Before bed I picked up my guitar, played some old chords and the words came out as a song; <a href="softening.html">a softening.</a></p>

You look seventeen, he said,
in my almost-too-small dungarees.
I hope not, I thought,
for I was a sad seventeen year old.
I hope I'm more child now
than I was then.

    <p>I've thought about updating my now page for a few days now and it's become a bit of a project in my head, which has made me put it off. I'm concerned about it going out of date, about feeling an obligation to update it. Maybe I feel like being reflective around this time of the month, maybe I don't, that's okay. It's a setting of intentions, which I hope will stay relevant for a time.</p>
