# a trans-Neptunian fossil freighter
[Enyo](Enyo.md)'s been stuck in this crashed ship, stranded 15 mins off the coast of Whibayganba. It houses an uprooted [Monolith](Monolith.md) that she uses to hold a never-ending puppet ball.

There's a beacon on top of The Brig that is never going out as long as Enyo lives in it. She can't help but [wish](Monolith.md) for more fossil fuel for it, as long as it stays stagnant it will live on top of an endless supply of energy. She has to wander, often far off, to appreciate the beacon's dreadful brilliance.

The ship is kept [ossified](hardening.md) by [Val](Val.md)'s lighthouse - when its's finally turned off it's revealed to have grown hermit crab legs underneath and is able to take Enyo's party anywhere she wishes. 

There's lots of conflicting dreams about The Brig...

[Rain](Rain.md) wanders for a long long time across a dried up ocean, treading on sea ferns, following a quiet signal to Enyo's ship. They make camp and [Cephi](Cephi.md) wakes them in the night.

Rain follows [Eris](Eris.md)' dead air to the ship, sneaks on board eavesdrops on them. If they don't drop in on their argument, Eris kills Enyo and takes off to raze [Utopia](Utopia-Planitia.md)! If they sabotage the engines, it crashes [the saturnalia](saturnalia.md).

[Rain](Rain.md) and [Enyo](Enyo.md) end up on a crash course to [Neptune](Eris-Enyo.md) together? She's cackling, dancing and thrashing all the extra weight off as they escape. Puppets dragging behind the ship like "just married" cans.
