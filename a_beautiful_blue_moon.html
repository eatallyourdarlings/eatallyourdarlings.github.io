<h1>a beautiful blue moon</h1>
<p><em>snippets of a really lovely day out, after being stuck at home for a while</em></p>
<p>talkin about all-gender sports teams and making weird guys out of clay and landlords and excellent toilets and starting a nudist venture commune with K and S and G and P and B and J and eating too-pricy quinoa  </p>
<p>G telling stories of high school kids being sweethearts and dickheads and HSIE being really important and boasting that they know where the sun is and not knowing how long it’s been since the Earth’s polarity flipped and having to ask the compass bearer “Old North or New North”?</p>
<p>having a nice honest check-in with C and telling the truth when asked ‘how have you been’ and weighing up which social media to maybe rejoin to try meet people again</p>
<p>being very honest and open and forgiving with V and making plans to have a tea party with the goanna gatekeeper in the bush near my place</p>
<p>talking drawing for self love and trusting your non-dominant hand and winning a silver medal at rock climbing (!) with W</p>
<p>having a micro-doof out the front of the venue with C after some sweet people tried making a ramp up the tiny little step for her and admiring how easily she chats to strangers and doesn’t let this is inaccesible world get her down</p>
<p>dancing like nobody’s watching to some fantastic bleeps and bloops with Y</p>
<p>chattin’ synths and software and geeking out over weird sound sources and electricity and oscilloscopes with F and J</p>
<p>talking perpetual musical amateurism and co-learning and sneaking cans into the neighbours’ recycling bins with S</p>
<p>skating with K and noticing how weird and sad the architecture is in the city sometimes </p>
<p>skipping and talking outdoor leadership and camping and taking up the sax and books with E and of course <em>Le Petit Prince</em> is his favourite book because I was <em>just</em> reading about Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</p>
<p>getting non verbal and infodumping bug facts with L and thinking maybe breeding moths is my calling and they’d break my heart </p>
<p>picking up a guitar and tuning to my voice not knowing I could do that and playing the same song I always play slightly differently to the cat and thinking about fill the airwaves with all my field recordings</p>
<p>talking pirate radio with a homemade FM transmitter and jamming outside and skating for the first time in years with J and actually I think being an actual pirate with a pirate radio is my calling</p>
<p>talking with V about gender and feeling love beyond language and making your own symbols and feeling appreciation for everyone questioning the gender binary in some small way </p>
<p>talking making music-making-things with F and J and admitting and embracing that we’re just grown-up kids playing with esoteric toys</p>
<p>grooving out to Little Simz around the kitchen bench with J and V</p>
<p>talking about trusting your intuition and playing the harp and making noise boxes and making a record using entirely one-off found sounds and making the radio video game for myself for my birthday and getting good therapy and accessing your childlike wonder and being inspired by my brilliant little cousins writing code for their legos on their iPads and writing poetry with/without a voice and finding the song for your words and romanticising everyday moments with B</p>
<p>admiring the funny little rodents I spray painted on a sign a few weeks ago and sitting on the bus writing this in the least self-editing way I can manage and sitting in the kitchen eating fantastic beans and rice and feeling a lot less lonely :]</p>
