DOTGRID BY HUNDRED RABBITS

***
notes from Olive:
one dot in the grid is 15px in CSS
when exporting a vector, it's the size of the <canvas> that determines the <svg> width/height
this means that if you zoom in, it'll export just the zoomed part of the vector.
if you start from the the top left, you can resize as you go without much issue.
using the arrow keys to move around and keyboard shortcuts below is generally a nice quick way to make a glyph, but I don't know if you can move points without using a mouse to click-drag.

Dotgrid is a grid-based vector drawing software designed to create logos, icons and type. 
It supports layers, the full SVG specs and additional effects such as mirroring and radial drawing. 
Dotgrid exports to both PNG and SVG files.

The application was initially created for internal use, 
and later made available as a free and open source software.
