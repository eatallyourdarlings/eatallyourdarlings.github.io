<h1>about</h1>
<p>hiya, my name's Olive. I'm a trans dyke who loves making stuff with my hands and my computer.</p>
<p>I'm living on unceded Worimi and Awabakal Country, Muloobinba/Newcastle on the east coast of so-called Australia.</p>
<p>In the pursuit of doing cool things with my 'puter whilst minimising my impact on the planet, I'm inspired by subcultures like ditherpunk, demoscene and <a target="_blank" href="https://permacomputing.net/">permacomputing</a> in particular.</p>

<p>writing about myself is scary, you're sure to learn a lot more about me by exploring the rest of this site &mdash; maybe see what I'm up to <a href="now.html">now?</a></p>

<h2 id="ethics">a brief note on ethics</h2>
<p>Amidst a hellscape of neoliberal democracies that so often settle for a conservative middle ground on matters of vital urgency like <em>the life of our planet and everything on it</em>, I find hope in knowing that a liveable future can come about through <em>collective action</em>.</p>
<p>I am <em>aggressively</em> opposed to capitalism, fascism, reactionism, racism, sexism, homophobia, speciesism, transphobia, nationalism, ethnocentrism, religious fundamentalism, and oppressive and coercive power structures in all their systemic and automated forms.</p>
<p>I am <em>committed</em> to undermining the capitalist structure and its abusive scripts about human worth in relation to work, productivity, and ownership. To subvert oppressive gender norms and put in question the binary. To actively unlearn biased and colonial thinking.</p>
<p>Some of this wording borrowed from Hundred Rabbits, who I've learnt—and continue to learn—a lot from.</p>
