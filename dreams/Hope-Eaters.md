# Hope Eaters
[Rain](Rain.md)'s unfound family, that they escape from at the beginning of their story.

> eat your hope find the freedom in despair.

an absurdist [Discordian](Eris.md) cult - post-military violent dancing troupe. all of its devotees are abducted as children and their tongues are cut out, so they've developed their own [battle languages](language.md). they are siblings in the manner of newborn turtles scrambling on a beach full of knowing that only a fraction of them will survive, feel a fleeting kinship. they're not entirely beyond hope, if they can find solidarity in their collectivity, realise they're othering, demonising, starving each other.

> Our accents come and go   
> With nerves and a healing heart   
> Escapism creeps into our recipes

 [Rain](Rain.md) may come to realise this when they visit other imperfect oases of freedom, and decide to try and disempower [Eris](Eris.md) by undermining her supremacy, but they can probably do that on their own without their heroism!
