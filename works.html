    <p><i>yearn</i> is my first web poem, with a little bit of interactivity. 
    <br>The background image was made with  <a href="tools/dither.html">a tiny tool for dithering</a>. 
    <br>You can view a plain-text version of the poem, <a href="yearn.txt">yearn dot txt</a> (300 bytes compared to the above's 300kb). </p>

    <p><em>three d-words on a moon</em> is my first Bitsy game. <br><blockquote>after a long journey through the lonely void of space... you've finally pinpointed the source of your gender envy to this gay little moon.</blockquote></p>
    <p><em>Little Guys</em> is a platformer about a witch in a wheelchair trying to navigate a treacherous path to a tea party. To do so they enlist the help of a couple magical little guys who help make the level more accessible for them. It's the first game I've ever put online, it's pretty janky and might not work in your browser.</p>

    <p><em>Heroyam Slava</em> is a short documentary film about my friend Sasha's time volunteering in a refugee camp in Poland, helping kids displaced by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. It was directed by my friend Len and I was lucky enough to get to write music for it, which I am very proud of. I wrote a bunch of small motifs inspired by Sasha's stories, then Chloe the sound design wiz pieced them together.

    <p>Soundcloud holds hostage various demos and some more soundtracks I've made for my friends' films. Most were made with Garageband on my old iPhone. If you really like any of these tracks, please <a href="contact.html">get in contact</a> and I'll send them to you for free so that you can listen to them offline and my tunes can have less of a carbon impact from streaming.</p>

    <h3>masked stinker</h3>
    <figure>
        <img src="img/masked-stinker.png" alt="A short, bone-thin masked critter holding a dagger in one hand. Its torso is black and featureless with limbs that appear smokey, only half-there. Its face is a horned and pointy-noised porcelain mask, grimacing on one side and smirking on the other. One eye socket is empty, a red eye between its lips instead. Its shadow looks like an open eye." loading="lazy" width="512" height="512">

    <p>Made this guy in a haze at 1AM. It was my first time trying the #256fes challenge, which is making a tiny 3D model with less than 256 triangles and an image texture with 256 pixels. Modelled and rendered in Blender and then manually painted over with Bayer matrix patterns, shrinking the image to a measly 4 kilobytes and adding details. It was a lot of fun doing the 'work' of a computer algorithm by hand, inspired by Raquel Meyers' practice of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.raquelmeyers.com/info_/">kybdsl√∂jd</a>.

    <h3>NEWYMATION</h3>

        <img src="img/newymation-invite.png" alt="A poster with text within ornate frames that evoke pop-up windows in a retro operating system. The main text reads: 'Do you make cool stuff with your computer? Well you should bring your cool stuff to NEWYMATION, a meet and greet for artists of all skill levels!' The title is styled after a neon sign and a bright red cockatrice is perched on its cables, as if leeching its energy." loading="lazy" width="512" height="512">

    <p>NEWYMATION is a pretty groovy local artist meetup that happens every few months! I made this textmode poster with <a target="_blank" href="https://lvllvl.com/">lvllvl dot com</a>, using PETSCII, the limited character set of the Commodore 64. It features a fearsome rendition of <a target="_blank" href="https://theroostcreative.com.au/">The Roost</a> mascot.

    <h3>helping hands</h3>

        <img src="img/hellhands.png" alt="A uninviting stone face composed of large stone hands looms out of the dark of a labyrinth. Four cupped hands make up its maw, with a mane of splayed fingers behind it. Two glowing hands float above, connected at the wrists, resembling a crown." loading="lazy" width="512" height="384">

    <p><br>Scrapped level concept for a 3D game jam, very much inspired by the Helping Hands of <i>Labyrinth (1986)</i>, which gave me nightmares as a kid. Modelled and rendered in Blender, then made crunchy with dithering - algorithmic and by hand. This hand rig has come in handy many times (heh).
