            made this guy in a haze at 1AM for the #256fes challenge, which means the model has 256 tris and the texture has 256 pixels. modelled and rendered in Blender and then manually painted over with Bayer matrix patterns. Inspired by Raquel Meyers' concept of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.raquelmeyers.com/info_/">kybdsl√∂jd</a>, it was a lot of fun doing the 'work' of a computer algorithm manually.

    <p>You can find some old demos on <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/eatallyourdarlings">my soundcloud</a>. I'm going to clean some of these up and share them here, maybe via <a target="_blank" href="https://simonrepp.com/faircamp/">faircamp</a>.
    <br> In the last couple years I've been asked to make soundtracks for my friends' films for school, and that's been a lot of fun.

    <h2 id="ludo">games?</h2>
    <p>I've put one janky little video game on the web, which you can at <a target="_blank" href="https://eatallyourdarlings.itch.io">itch.io</a>, but it may not work in your browser. I tried studying gamedev at uni for a couple years but it super burnt me out so I haven't released anything since. I have been gradually working on personal projects and self-teaching and hope to share more soon.</p>
