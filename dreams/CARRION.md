CARRION is an egregore of all of the subconsciousnesses of [Mars](Mars.md), living or otherwise. All the worst bits are eating themselves inside out, making it a pretty scary state to be in. 

> YOU WILL DREAM OF TEETH AND NOTHING ELSE.

[frequencies](radio.md) flooded with whispering nightmares that are gnashing jaws on an [oscilloscope](thingamabob.md). carrion [feeders](dogs.md) grapple to the top of the teleological food chain.

There's no central heart to CARRION since [Monolith](Monolith.md) is a network, but there are increasingly more [eidola](eidolon.md) as you get closer to [the storm](Utopia-Planitia.md), and [dreams](dream.md) get more confused and restless in its proximity.
