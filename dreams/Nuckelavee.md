# this horse is fucked up bruh

A man-horse from Orkney folklore that comes out of the ocean during Winter to terrorise villages on the coast. Wages war with the Mither o' the Sea (Winter) on behalf of [Teran](Teran.md) (Summer).

[Rain](Rain.md) can confront Nuckelavee follows [Cephi](Cephi.md) in the [Concrete_Forest](Concrete_Forest.md),  

It has at least six trunk-like legs wound up with aggregated [eidola](eidolon.md). Peacock-feather like neon lights flare up when it's in combat, but damaged so they look more like dreadful urchin spikes, depth charges.  It has the severed heads of other beasts caught in its antlers.

*Dullahan* are headless horsemen that ride in silent coaches, bearing objects created from human bones - most commonly a whip made of a spinal cord. They also often see through their severed heads.

Adrammelech is described as a great Marquis with a human torso, peacock tale, and mule's head, who raises great noises and teaches cunning in astronomy, and when in human form also teaches geometry in a perfect manner. He is also described as ruling over thirty legions and as having the ability to turn any man into a bird.
