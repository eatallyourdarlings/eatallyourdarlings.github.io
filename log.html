    <p>I've thought about updating my now page for a few days now and it's become a bit of a project in my head, which has made me put it off. I'm concerned about it going out of date, about feeling an obligation to update it. Maybe I feel like being reflective around this time of the month, maybe I don't, that's okay. It's a setting of intentions, which I hope will stay relevant for a time.</p>

    <p>what if the dates were a li'l more magical; if I started paying closer attention to Luna's phases?</p>
