![asterasteraster](asterasteraster.gif)

I dream of red dogstars dancing, most often in harmonious threes, but sometimes there's only two of them, despairing at the loss of their third, and sometimes there's [just one](Sol.md), crying at the loss of its twin.

I dreamt of a darkened trinary system choked in brambles. Three starving, dwarfed stars, each ringed in thorns, redshifting into oblivion. [Monolith](Monolith.md) has turned this fetid system to a seed farm, introducing dissonance into its gravity-songs, causing planets to crush each other and send asteroid-carriers to germinate other systems.

Everyone has [dreams](dream.md) of the asterism at some point. It's an uncanny dream without the usual lucidity of human memories - a timelost yearning, to seek/return to those red stars. [Eris](Eris.md)' red star sigil looks enough like this asterism - and her visions of utopia are assertive enough to be infectious - that many lost folk think following her is the answer, and are ready to accept her as a King heralded by their dreams.
