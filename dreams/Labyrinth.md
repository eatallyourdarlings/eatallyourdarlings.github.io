[Rain](Rain.md)/[Scout](Scout.md) lost in a labyrinth carved out of concrete that sealed nuclear waste. Far-too-many-boned Labyrinthodon vertebrae in the walls lit by phosphorus. Leaving a trail of dead little breadcrumbs that look like rain frogs but they bite. They're stalked by a stone sphinx, billboarding to match the texture of the walls, invisible from its viewing angle.

[PHO](biodiesel-bikies.md) are heralds/recruiters of the forever-fighting gladiatorial cult at the labyrinth's heart.
