<h1 id="cephi">Cephi</h1>
<p>Cephi’s an otherworldly wonderer, blessed with lepidopterativism on a particularly <a href="otherverses.html">uncanny version of Earth</a> . She was called to this version of <a href="Mars.html">Mars</a> by the wishes of the <a href="Concrete_Forest.html">Concrete_Forest</a>. Cephi’s body was reshaped by their desires, but she’s escaping that and reclaiming her body for her self. Cephi is gender euphoria and forgetful forgiveness! She’s mostly a nudist aside from sometimes masks, body paint, cool things in her hair.</p>
<p>She <a href="dream.html">dreams</a> of greener, slower things.</p>
<p>She remembers being born on Earth, senses that things are really <em>off</em> - the 25 hour days, the chaotic twin moon cycles discoordinated from the menstrual cycle. She has a deep-seeded-sense-memory that <a href="Luna.html">Luna</a> might be reborn, maybe, or sung into a closer orbit.</p>
<p>Cephi has a tail coming from her crotch, ending in an eye that shows Luna’s current phase. She undergoes different stages of a memory/rebirth cycle in sync with the lunar phases.</p>
<p>By the light of the Full Moon, her body is translucent like a glass frog. She has no mouth, but she can take off her head and dance with it. Her slender feather/antenna tail curls around her shoulders expressively. Her crotch blooms with aposematic wings of a luna moth/tiger flower. Cephi is at peak memory-loss! She sees a staircase of moonlight and follows it across the saltpan, almost every time finding her way to <a href="Enyo.html">Enyo</a>. When an anxious archivist, concerned with remembering everything, meets a blank slate, what would they talk about? Each time Enyo could try out a different script, be a different person!</p>
<p>One night her usual wandering is disrupted as she meets <a href="Rain.html">Rain</a> on the path.</p>

<p>By the light of the New Moon, her body grows iridescent RGBA fur. The memories of her traumatic birth show on her body. A scar-seam is illuminated on her face, to tear along when she needs to scream. Her tail appears like gynaecological prongs/wire growing around inverted hermaphroditic sex organs, all dragging heavily behind her and <a href="hardening.html">calcifying</a>.</p>
