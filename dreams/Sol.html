<h1 id="our-sun-is-missing-a-twin-or-two">our Sun is missing a twin or two</h1>
<p>E told me that Sol used to have a twin :[</p>
<blockquote>
<p>when stars die dont they become hyperdense and lose their glow and develop an inescaple gravitational pull? sounds like crushing loneliness to me idk</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Solar souls</strong> - organisms that were closer to the point of creation have a better understanding that all souls come from Sol, and recognise their <em>sol mates</em>.</p>
<p>Souls are bonded in threes: - an actor - an observer - a chronicler</p>
<p>So as an example from <a href="Doggerland.html">pre-history</a>, a strong triad would have been a bond between: - a pre-human (e.g. Neanderthal) - a megafauna - a beetle</p>
<p>Maybe their consciousness is distributed between them, on some level. They all have an <a href="asterasteraster.html">asterism</a> that they see each other in :]</p>
<p>Sol’s yearning for a twin leads to a repetition of gravitational history.</p>
