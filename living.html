<h1>notes for being my self.</h1>
<p>start from questions like: <em>What could a good day be?</em></p>
<p><strong>Just living is enough.</strong> Living for more than your own sake is radical.</p>
<p><strong>Play every day.</strong> Play is praxis.</p>
<p><strong>You are so important already</strong>. Let those expectations soften. Now a little more. Getting there.</p>
<p><strong>Your future self will be grateful to you</strong> for the time you take to tend to ideas, inurgently; for knowing when to hit record and when to let a moment pass; for the time you set aside to focus on what you have capacity for in the present; and for letting less urgent things wait for the future. Don’t delude yourself into thinking you ever have it all figured out. You’ve generally always thought of your self of three to six months past as a fool, and pitied your self two years ago. Maybe that can change.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You want to tell a story - but you want to save some for yourself. Don’t do too much. What do you want to share, first? Can you share less? And less. And less. And less. Now you’re writing for yourself - almost.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>a day</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Waking up feels good. You should stretch when you wake—your voice, your hands, your knees. You wake up, you give thanks, you go for a walk around the block and give thanks again. If it’s early, it’s just you and the trees and the songs will come visit you either way. The melody might come dressed like lightning bugs. It might swing down from the crest of a hill and brush over you like wind. When it does come, be ready to grab it fast.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As soon as you can after waking, if you can, get outside. <strong>Refresh your brain by getting into your senses.</strong> Try and find a bird song or other sound, a texture, a thing that catches your eye like an oddly shaped cloud. Don’t neglect your wonderful nose. Try to <strong>inhabit the feelings lingering from any dreams you were having</strong>, to remember and perhaps record the stories your brain was telling or make up new stories from those feelings.</p>
<p><strong>Drink</strong> at least a cup of water when you wake up, and <strong>brush your teeth</strong> first thing.</p>
<p><strong>Get moving</strong> as soon as you can, whether it’s just ten minutes of stretches, or a jog, yoga, dancing, drumming, thrashing, climbing a tree.</p>
<p><strong>Delay breakfast</strong> and coffee by at least 30 minutes after waking, if you can. Sometimes up to 90 minutes has felt great. Your brain can be pretty sharp and creative in the morning if you don’t do distracting things to numb it.</p>
<p>Good evenings are not so easy to place, yet. The best ones usually involve cooking together and dancing and stargazing. It’s also a great time to call a friend, and to play. Reading for thirty minutes before closing my eyes is a great habit.</p>
<h2>keep going</h2>
<p><strong>Sleep</strong> changes based on your energy needs and the seasons. 8 hours is a good average. Getting a restful sleep is essential to allow for dreaming. Getting up at dawn is delightful but it isn’t for everyone. If you can get into a <strong>consistent sleeping routine without relying on any reminders or alarms</strong>, that is ideal. Consistent does not mean the same every day, it means there is a stable average. I’m grateful for the kookaburras on the powerlines outside my window, having a cackle at dawn. I’m grateful for my body taking the extra hour or so it needs sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>Rest</strong> is always a good use of your time. Naps are the best.</p>
<p><strong>Indulging</strong> in art and creature comforts is great. Try to enjoy one thing fully at a time, resisting the urge to numb your brain, to kill your conscience. In general, you will feel great if you stop indulging just before you start to feel exhausted and restless, at which point you’re losing rather than gaining energy from the activity. Unless of course that restlessness is because you’re unwell or haven’t allowed yourself to rest for so long in a while. <strong>Escapism</strong> can be a curse. Being overly conscious of it can make you feel guilty for seeking comfort—particularly for consuming good media—while being unconscious of it can shift your definition of what comfort is. <strong>Addiction</strong> comes in many forms and can’t be dealt with alone. <strong>Banish the guilt</strong> in your brain from the years of being social media addicted. <strong>Things get better.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Getting lost</strong> [on the internet] is a valid and inspiring creature comfort, but it can overwhelm, so it’s best to do it inside of pockets of time.</p>
<p><strong>Experiment constantly in small, slow ways</strong>. With new ways of thinking, reflecting, having conversations, writing, moving, navigating, creating, researching, listening, feeling. <strong>Reflect and revise</strong>; your idea of your self; your cornerstone values; self-help things like this document.</p>
<p>Find little <strong>periodic rituals</strong> that work for you, things you can fall back and rely on to avoid overwhelming yourself. This could be, for example, room cleans on Saturdays, evening journalling, computer reboots in the mornings.</p>
<p>Listening to an album or radio show as a container of time is a lot nicer than a pomodoro.</p>
<p><strong>Stop working before reaching exhaustion</strong>, leaving energy for other essential life things, if you want to think about it in quantitative terms then preserve at least 20%-30%.</p>
<p><strong>Try things on paper first</strong> for a little while before you try to find a software solution, particularly for lifestyle systems like goals, time tracking, journalling.</p>
<p><strong>Living intentionally</strong> is not easy, and it means something different to everyone.</p>
<p>Breaking down what I’m thinking about into little atomic parts and seeing how they fit back together can be a great exercise. These parts can be values that you want to keep close to heart, aesthetics, practices, goals, research areas. This allows for <strong>forgiveness and less urgency</strong> in personal projects - you can draw all these connecting threads between the things you want to do and find how working towards them can be fulfilling.</p>
<p>When you sit down to do something, particularly at a computer, have <strong>at least a vague intention</strong> and an amount of time you think you can spend on working towards this intention. Get up from a chair at least once an hour. Focus your eyes on longer distance things, relax your shoulders and stretch your legs and hands.</p>
<p>You can consider each thing you do in a day to be on a spectrum of <strong>introverted to extroverted</strong>, and then start to try to pay attention to what you need to have the energy for these.</p>
<p>Try and make an effort to <strong>reach out to at least one person each day</strong>, and that will come back to you in kind. Days where I have texted a whole bunch of people at once to ask to hang out have always left me feeling despairing, because of course there’s going to be a low ratio of messages sent in a day to responses received.</p>
<p><strong>Eat well</strong> (vegan) grow your own fruit and herbs and veg if you can, ideally in a communal way. Pay attention to your stool; on a good day, I only need to use the loo once and without trouble, but I’m lucky not to have any illness related to that.</p>
<p><strong>Drop</strong> is a natural, but unpleasant feeling after an intense experience (including an intense positive experience). It’s natural and treated with aftercare. Rest, do things you enjoy, but primarily recognise that you are in drop and don’t put too much pressure on yourself.</p>

<p><a href="https://ajkprojects.com/stopactinglikeyourefamous" target="_blank">You aren’t famous</a>. Anything you do or create will probably receive little to no attention, so stop optimizing for a non-existent audience and instead focus on what makes you enjoy the activity.</p>

<li>Any of the saddest and happiest moments in her life were the result of always speaking her mind and never backing down from telling the Truth that she saw it.</li>
<li>A Good life comes from pursuing what you want with all the effort you can muster.</li>
<li>Knowing what you want requires you first to be okay with yourself and accepting of who you are.</li>
<li>Make sure you have plenty of time by yourself to think and organize your thoughts.</li>
<li>The limitations of our lives are often imposed upon us. What we believe is possible. Rules are basically fake.</li>
<li>Sharing with others (thoughts, creations, even food and touch) is the only way to change you and others</li>

<p>Who am I to give advice?<br />
I’m just someone trying to live a fulfilling life, exactly like everyone else.<br />
And a lot of the “advice” I write about is myself exploring and sharing what is working at the time.<br />
Because of this, it isn’t unusual for me to look back on posts and think, “Oh right, I used to do/think that. But writing and sharing this stuff has been critical in improving my life.<br />
So in a sense, my “cosplaying” as a source of self-help for other people is really just myself practicing self-help.<br />
And if people get inspired to try something out by it, that makes it worth continuing despite my criticisms about self-help. - <a href="https://ajkprojects.com/self-help.html" target="_blank">Self-help from AJK</a></p>
