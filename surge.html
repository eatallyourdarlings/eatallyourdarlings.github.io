<p>It really excites me to be a part of a bigger ensemble performance as my creativity has been a bit introverted and self-motivated for a while! My urge was to apply to pitch a solo work, but the ensemble would get me out of my comfort zone. I’m excited to learn skills in working collaboratively to realise a performance, and to have the support of facilitating artists in developing my practice. I could bring lots of knowledge and fresh ideas from my passion for internet and creative computing performance culture, as there isn’t much of a scene of this in Newcastle.</p>
<p>My art practice usually involves creating I’ve written and played music in private and have played the occasional gig/open mic. I’ve been recently doing these desktop performances where I hit record as I’m coding and think out loud, or let the code run and sing/play along with it. I’d be excited to explore this role further as a sort of conductor/choreographer/live audio generator.</p>
<p>I’m very inspired by butoh dancing and often find myself surging about in my room (get it) instinctually to electronic music. I haven’t much of a background in dance but would love help in practicing this and building confidence to share this in performance. I think it would be super electrifying to respond to my live-coded generative, un/scripted music with generative, un/scripted dance!</p>
