<p>I dream of red dogstars dancing, most often in harmonious threes, but sometimes there’s only two of them, despairing at the loss of their third, and sometimes there’s <a href="Sol.html">just one</a>, crying at the loss of its <a href="twins.html">twin</a>.</p>
<p>I dreamt of a darkened trinary system choked in brambles. Three starving, dwarfed stars, each ringed in thorns, redshifting into oblivion. <a href="Monolith.html">Monolith</a> has turned this fetid system to a seed farm, introducing dissonance into its gravity-songs, causing planets to crush each other and send asteroid-carriers to germinate other systems.</p>
<p>Everyone has <a href="dream.html">dreams</a> of the asterism at some point. It’s an uncanny dream without the usual lucidity of human memories - a timelost yearning, to seek/return to those red stars. <a href="Eris.html">Eris</a>’ red star sigil looks enough like this asterism - and her visions of utopia are assertive enough to be infectious - that many lost folk think following her is the answer, and are ready to accept her as a King heralded by their dreams.</p>
