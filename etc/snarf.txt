/about
<!-- <p>I am for meeting these assaults on the biosphere with joyous, grieving, enraged action. Our era demands preposterous thinking, bold experimentation, leaps and loops and flights of faith. I am for <a href="https://www.creationtheproject.com/about" target="_blank">CREATION</a>, a queer-insurrectionary-science-fiction-religion-as-art.</p> -->

/badges
<!-- <p>for now the rest of the collection is hidden in HTML comments because I'm yet to reach out reach out to all these cool folk and ask if they'd like our sites to hold hands. And also maybe to avoid loading tons of images from other servers. idk if loady lazing helps with that. it'd be nice to not hotlink these maybe? or if I loaded them from other servers it could be like a nice status page, checking in on these cool websites and seeing if they're still all good. maybe they might even change the badge at the given URL, that'd be a nice surprise. </p>
