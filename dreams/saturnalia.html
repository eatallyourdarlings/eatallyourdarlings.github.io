<h1 id="were-all-going-to-be-eaten-by-giants-far-sooner-than-we-thought.">we’re all going to be eaten by giants far sooner than we thought.</h1>
<p>(o gosh this dream was fucked up)</p>
<p>A dreadful convergence; the slow yearning of a <a href="Sol.html">cold sun</a> to be twinned again, accelerated by the desires of <a href="forgotten-god-kings.html">forgotten-god-kings</a> for <a href="post-solarpunk.html">perpetual energy</a> and <a href="Monolith.html">Monolith</a> dissecting the gravitational memory of the system, altogether bringing about a repetition of <em>The Grand Tack</em>: Jupiter and Saturn’s gluttonous swing through the nascent solar system that aborted <a href="Mars.html">Mars</a> in the first place, coming back around to eat the rest.</p>
<p>idk what the timeline is, but maybe, ironically, tragically, Jupiter could be ‘stably’ twinned just in time for Sol to go supernova. for <a href="Val.html">Val</a>, in his timelost wanderings, to feel the winds burn away the last of his memory.</p>
<h2 id="so-lets-have-a-jig">so let’s have a jig!</h2>
<p>The terrible gravity of the giants has been known for generations by this merry troupe, and celebrated. Like a parallel to <a href="Enyo.html">Enyo</a>’s unceasing dancers. Saturn’s finally devouring all his kids! Hurrah! The first sacrifices for this <em>much brighter future</em>! An eternal Saturnalia! <em>gas-giant, gastronomy, astronomy</em>, there’s something there.</p>
<p>I picture a lot of rosy bums skipping around firelight, fauns and fairies. maybe this is to do with <a href="Concrete_Forest.html">Concrete_Forest</a>, or a nomadic troupe that passes through there, at least.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Participants in insurrection invariably note its festive aspects, even in the midst of armed struggle, danger, and risk. The uprising is like a saturnalia which has slipped loose (or been forced to vanish) from its intercalary interval and is now at liberty to pop up anywhere or when. from <em>The Temporary Autonomous Zone</em> by Hakim Bey</p>
