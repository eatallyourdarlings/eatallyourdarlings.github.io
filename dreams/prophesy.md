# some brave fool has got to force Mars back to life

[Val](Val.md) and his lineage groom [heroes](heroes.md) into thinking it's their destiny to further fuck up the [climate on Mars](Mars.md) and (re)create the [Earth](Earth.md). Whether they believe the blue planet they're creating is a sequel or the original, they're just different branchings of the same oppressive story. 

## how are they tangled up in it?
- [Rain](Rain.md) could fall for it if they don't question what they're told.
- [Eris](Eris.md) is still falling for it.
- [Enyo](Enyo.md) has given up on it, but she's cruel and hedonistic and loves to watch Eris fuck the world. Even upon discovering that Phobos would collapse peacefully and people would live on free of that dread, it would take a miracle to get her to try and change Eris' mind.
