<p>A good approximation of the wind-chill temperature can be found by <strong>multiplying the wind speed by 0.7 and then subtracting that value from the air temperature</strong>.</p>
<p>If you count the number of cricket chirps in 14 seconds and add 40, youâ€™ll have the temperature in Fahrenheit.</p>
<p><strong>Lightning 30:30 Rule</strong>: If it takes less than 30 seconds to hear thunder after seeing the flash, <strong>LIGHTNING</strong> is near enough to pose a threat. After the storm ends, wait 30 minutes before resuming outdoor activities. If caught out in the open, squatting with feet together means that if struck it may only pass through your legs. If you can, sit on anything that you own, particularly a backpack.</p>
<p>Marine wind speeds mentioned in forecasts and warnings are averages, and that wind gusts can be 40 per cent stronger, and stronger still in the vicinity of thunderstorms and squalls.</p>
<p>When in a fire, keep low, go through already burnt areas, put a damp towel over your mouth and nose to breathe through smoke.</p>
