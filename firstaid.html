<h2>glossary</h2>
<p>AED/defib - automated external defibrillator. CPR - cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 30 compressions followed by two breaths.</p>
<p>A useful acronym to remember what questions you can ask someone to get a brief history, a <strong>SAMPLE:</strong> - Signs/Symptoms - Allergies - Medications - Previous injury/illness - Last meal - Events prior to incident</p>
<p><strong>DRSABCD</strong> - Danger? suitable protection? - Responsive? - Send for help! - Airways open? - Breathing? - CPR - Defibrilator</p>
<h2>emergency services from states</h2>
<p><strong>112</strong> is the international emergency number that should be able to be called from any mobile phone and connect to the country’s emergency service.</p>
<h2>consent</h2>
<p>assume consent if they’re unconscious, but always seek to regain and maintain informed consent by speaking to them as if they were conscious.</p>
<h2>the patient is a person first.</h2>
<p>Encourage the casualty to treat themselves, for example, apply pressure to their own bleeding wound.</p>
<p><strong>Do not move the casualty, unless:</strong> - there are any immediate threats to life such as water, fire and explosion - you are unable to provide life saving measures in their current position, such as when you need to provide CPR and the casualty is on a bed - the patient is unconscious and breathing, so should be moved into the recovery (side-lying) position.</p>
<p>Do <strong>not</strong> touch a vehicle or attempt to rescue a person within 10m of a fallen power line.</p>
<p>You should <strong>only remove a helmet</strong> to assist with breathing, maintain an open airway, manage bleeding or provide CPR. Motorbike helmets provide support to the head, neck and spine and can help prevent further injury.</p>
<p><strong>Managing the casualty’s airway and any severe bleeding takes priority over cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and all other treatments.</strong> This takes priority over other injuries (including any possible head, neck and spinal injuries).</p>
<ul>
<li>First, check for any airway obstruction by carefully and gently turning the casualty onto their side. Their mouth should be open and tilted slightly downwards to allow any fluid to drain.</li>
<li>Remove any solid material using a sweeping motion with the fingers.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a casualty who has drowned, roll them onto their side to allow water to drain and clear the airway.</p>
<p>If the casualty vomits during CPR, roll the casualty onto their side, and manually clear their airway, before rolling them onto their back and continuing CPR.</p>
